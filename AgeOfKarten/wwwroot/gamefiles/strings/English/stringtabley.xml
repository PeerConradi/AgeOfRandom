    <string _locid="35951" symbol="cStringRMSYucatanlongdesc">The Central America rain forests are home to many Treasures. Each player will start with a nearby Zapotec or Maya village.

    <string _locid="37438">&lt;b&gt;About Musketeers:&lt;/b&gt;\n Musketeers were an infantry soldier who stood in ranks for two and three men deep, taking turns firing while other ranks reloaded. Muskets were drilled and disciplined to stand as close as 80 yards away from an enemy firing right back at them. Musket balls ranged from about 1/2" in diameter to 3/4" in diameter. Until long guns with rifled barrels that could be fired more than once every two minutes were developed, muskets were the ranged weapon of choice for infantry. \n \n Muskets had a relatively short range and were wildly inaccurate.. Musketeers fought an awful lot like longbowmen, firing volley after volley in the direction of the enemy with no specific target. The barrage of lead was bound to hit something. A competent musketeer could fire 3 shots in a minute. Four times slower than a longbow and twice as fast as an early rifle.</string>

    <string _locid="41716">Napoleon can be ambitious to the point of rudeness. He adapts his strategy to the situation, but prefers to attack with large armies of fully upgraded units, especially cavalry. He taunts his enemies frequently and may not follow his allies' lead. </string>

    <string _locid="47283">Our enemy has help. I fear their combined force may be too strong.</string>

    <string _locid="47285">My plans for siege are already in progress.</string>

    <string _locid="47288">My people do not have the resources for that.</string>
    <string _locid="47289">The spirits will not allow that.</string>
    <string _locid="47290">My warriors are elsewhere. I have no men to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47291">The spirits prevent me from doing that.</string>
    <string _locid="47292">My force is not big enough. I will not send them into slaughter.</string>
    <string _locid="47293">Our enemy is sly. They have destroyed a post.</string>
    <string _locid="47294">The journey here has not been kind to these British people. There is not much fight in them.</string>
    <string _locid="47295">It will not be long before these Dutchmen are mourning their dead.</string>
    <string _locid="47296">The French will soon be driven from these lands forever.</string>
    <string _locid="47297">Watch as these Germans are driven before our warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47298">See how their warriors fall. This so-called empire can never last.</string>
    <string _locid="47299">If only all of our enemies fell as easily as these Portuguese.</string>
    <string _locid="47300">The Russian hordes are no match for our superior warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47301">Soon all of the Spanish will vanish from these lands.</string>
    <string _locid="47302">These Aztecs will feast on no bones except their own.</string>
    <string _locid="47303">It saddens me to crush my Native brothers.</string>
    <string _locid="47305">Their voyage has made these British strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47306">These Dutch fight with the strength of the buffalo.</string>
    <string _locid="47307">Where do the French find such power?</string>
    <string _locid="47308">These Germans fight like bears.</string>
    <string _locid="47309">These Ottomans are stronger than I expected. </string>
    <string _locid="47310">It pains me that I underestimated these Portuguese.</string>
    <string _locid="47311">The strength of the Russians is great.</string>
    <string _locid="47312">The spirits give strength to these Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="47313">The reputation of the Aztecs is true. They are quite strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47314">The spirits have been kind to my brothers. Their strength is formidable.</string>
    <string _locid="47316">Be careful you are not devoting too many resources to advancing in age. The battle ahead will be long.</string>
    <string _locid="47317">It would seem our enemy values the superiority of Native warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47319">Why do you linger behind? Advance in age or our enemy will have the advantage.</string>
    <string _locid="47320">A bold move, advancing in age so quickly. But make sure you balance your resources.</string>
    <string _locid="47321">I hope that being the last to advance in age is part of a strategy and not just dragging your feet.</string>
    <string _locid="47322">You have my thanks for your help.</string>
    <string _locid="47323">That is how we deal with enemies who sneak like a snake in the grass.</string>
    <string _locid="47324">Our enemy has lost his hold over my Native brothers.</string>
    <string _locid="47325">That is how to clean the scourge of settlement from our lands.</string>
    <string _locid="47326">With this post down, our enemy will lose sway in this area.</string>
    <string _locid="47327">I have failed to liberate my brothers.</string>
    <string _locid="47328">Our enemy has grown strong. Not even I could destroy that town.</string>
    <string _locid="47329">Our enemy continues to profit from fouling these lands.</string>
    <string _locid="47330">My war chief is down and I can not collect treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="47331">Killed by an animal? The spirits mock me.</string>
    <string _locid="47332">I cannot continue against such odds. </string>
    <string _locid="47333">It is time to quit.</string>
    <string _locid="47334">It would be advantageous for you to send help here.</string>
    <string _locid="47335">Many men are attacking my town.</string>
    <string _locid="47336">Welcome. Follow my lead if you want to win.</string>
    <string _locid="47337">I see you think you are ready for a bigger challenge.</string>
    <string _locid="47338">It is probably better that you choose an easier game.</string>
    <string _locid="47339">I hope you play as well now as you did the last time we met.</string>
    <string _locid="47340">I may yet have something to learn from someone who leads like you did last time.</string>
    <string _locid="47341">Your last effort disgraced the spirits. Try harder this time.</string>
    <string _locid="47342">You will need to do much better this time to keep up with my score.</string>
    <string _locid="47343">I remember these lands. That can only add to our tactical advantage.</string>
    <string _locid="47344">Do not drag me down this time. </string>
    <string _locid="47345">We are strong together. I hope to do well again.</string>
    <string _locid="47346">The will of our people has brought our war chief back to us.</string>
    <string _locid="47347">Their Town Center looks undefended.</string>
    <string _locid="47348">Our enemy has failed to protect its Town Center with a barracks.</string>
    <string _locid="47349">Our enemy seems to have no horsemen.</string>
    <string _locid="47350">Take this wealth and use it wisely.</string>
    <string _locid="47351">My people have gathered food for you.</string>
    <string _locid="47352">This wood should help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47353">It is time to strike our enemy. I am going after this town.</string>
    <string _locid="47354">I am striking at our enemy's villagers.</string>
    <string _locid="47355">The time is right. I am attacking our enemy's main town.</string>
    <string _locid="47356">I am moving to free my brothers from our enemy's influence.</string>
    <string _locid="47357">I am going to strike our enemy's trade post.</string>
    <string _locid="47358">You were wise to hit our enemy there. I will follow up your attack.</string>
    <string _locid="47359">My warriors will train from here.</string>
    <string _locid="47360">My people will set up camp here.</string>
    <string _locid="47361">I will seek the help of my Native brothers.</string>
    <string _locid="47362">I will take this trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="47363">My people will defend this building.</string>
    <string _locid="47364">My warriors will defend this area.</string>
    <string _locid="47365">I will defend my Native brothers here.</string>
    <string _locid="47366">The people in this town will resist to the last man.</string>
    <string _locid="47367">I will tell my warriors to defend this trading post.</string>
    <string _locid="47368">My people have plenty of wealth. We will send some to you.</string>
    <string _locid="47369">Our harvests have been bountiful. We will send you food.</string>
    <string _locid="47370">The forests here have given us much. We will continue to send you wood.</string>
    <string _locid="47371">My people are on their way to help you here.</string>
    <string _locid="47372">The spirits have been quiet lately.</string>
    <string _locid="47373">My people have need of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="47374">The herds are thin. We need food.</string>
    <string _locid="47375">My people need wood to expand our territory.</string>
    <string _locid="47376">Your help in that battle was well-timed.</string>
    <string _locid="47377">You have my thanks for the coin.</string>
    <string _locid="47378">This food will help. Thank you.</string>
    <string _locid="47379">Your quick action saved many of my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47380">Those resources will nourish my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47381">This wood will help us to build.</string>
    <string _locid="47382">Their voyage across the sea has made these British strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47383">These Dutchmen are strong fighters.</string>
    <string _locid="47384">I would not have believed these Frenchmen to be so strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47385">These Germans have more fight than I had hoped.</string>
    <string _locid="47386">This empire has produced a worthy enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="47387">These Portuguese have the strength of the buffalo.</string>
    <string _locid="47388">These Russians are a strong-willed people.</string>
    <string _locid="47389">These Spanish warriors fight with skill.</string>
    <string _locid="47390">The reputation of the Aztecs is well-deserved.</string>
    <string _locid="47391">It is no surprise that these Natives are fierce warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47393">How can we be losing to these weak British?</string>
    <string _locid="47394">We struggle against an inferior Dutch army.</string>
    <string _locid="47395">I am puzzled by our failure to rout these weak Frenchmen.</string>
    <string _locid="47396">These Germans are weak. We should be doing better.</string>
    <string _locid="47397">These Ottomans win despite our superiority.</string>
    <string _locid="47398">How do these Portuguese better us, the stronger team?</string>
    <string _locid="47399">These weak Russians are beating us.</string>
    <string _locid="47400">We are losing, despite the weakness of the Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="47401">How can we do better against these weak Aztecs?</string>
    <string _locid="47402">We must try harder against these weaker Haudenosaunee.</string>
    <string _locid="47404">You have the strength of a bear, but we are still behind.</string>
    <string _locid="47405">I cannot win alone. You must summon more strength.</string>
    <string _locid="47406">Our strength is superior to our enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47407">The spirits seem to favor you. You are very strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47408">We appear to be ahead, but I need you to find more strength.</string>
    <string _locid="47409">It appears our enemies have bested us this day.</string>
    <string _locid="47410">Your spirit is strong, but I fear the battle is over.</string>
    <string _locid="47411">You are foolish to drag your people into senseless battles. Let us make peace.</string>
    <string _locid="47412">Call your warriors! We need to destroy our enemy's trading posts.</string>
    <string _locid="47413">Our enemy is wise to seek the aid of the locals.</string>
    <string _locid="47414">Our enemy seeks to bolster his economy with a trading post.</string>
    <string _locid="47415">Our enemy continues to seek help from the locals.</string>
    <string _locid="47416">It seems our enemy has gained the advantage in Trading Posts.</string>
    <string _locid="47417">I will ask my brothers for help.</string>
    <string _locid="47418">I will take a Trading Post to help our economies.</string>
    <string _locid="47419">A fine move getting ahead in Treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="47420">That treasure will help us to destroy our enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47421">Use that wealth to train some warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47422">That food will help feed your warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47423">You would seem to be very familiar with these lands, but don't let those treasures distract you.</string>
    <string _locid="47424">I'll forgive that, but don't steal from my people again.</string>
    <string _locid="47425">I see you have found a warrior to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47427">That wood will help you to expand your town.</string>
    <string _locid="47428">You are wise to keep us ahead of their Native settlements.</string>
    <string _locid="47429">That extra trading post will give us an economic advantage.</string>
    <string _locid="47430">I hope those walls are strong. They could never keep out my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47431">I know the power of these people. They will help us in our struggle.</string>
    <string _locid="47432">Now I have the first trading post. It will be easy for the council to get supplies to me.</string>
    <string _locid="47433">This will help me to crush our enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="47434">This coin will pay for many warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47435">More food for my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47436">I know that you did not need this treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="47437">What is your war chief doing? He should be out gathering treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="47438">See how the Natives flock to our cause?</string>
    <string _locid="47439">These villagers will help our cause.</string>
    <string _locid="47440">This wood will help to build my settlement.</string>
    <string _locid="47441">More Natives will help us out.</string>
    <string _locid="47442">Another trading post has been added to our tribe.</string>
    <string _locid="47443">These walls will help to defend my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47444">The stage is set. Prepare to defend these posts to the last man.</string>
    <string _locid="47445">What has happened? You used to be a better leader.</string>
    <string _locid="47446">You have been busy. Your people must be proud.</string>
    <string _locid="47447">I see you have fought many battles since the last time we met.</string>
    <string _locid="47448">Though time is short, you have no idea where I will attack.</string>
    <string _locid="47449">Where is your strength now? We are about to destroy you.</string>
    <string _locid="47450">These combined forces can only mean victory for us.</string>
    <string _locid="47451">Your skill is impressive. I was sure I had won.</string>
    <string _locid="47452">See how easily I crush your inferior warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47453">A fine choice, facing my superior warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47454">Do you see how we are united against you? </string>
    <string _locid="47455">Do you not have the courage to face me alone? </string>
    <string _locid="47456">What spirit is helping you, that you are able to advance in age so quickly?</string>
    <string _locid="47457">You are wise to seek help from the locals, but you will still be defeated.</string>
    <string _locid="47458">That will not help you. My brothers are united against you.</string>
    <string _locid="47459">You can burn my town, but we will melt into the wilderness and strike back at you.</string>
    <string _locid="47460">That trading post was not needed. </string>
    <string _locid="47461">It is unwise to linger in the first age. You will have nothing to defend yourself with against my warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47462">You are falling behind. Please, construct a town worthy for my warriors to destroy.</string>
    <string _locid="47463">So many resources wasted so soon. Are you up to something?</string>
    <string _locid="47464">I hope your ally is able to support you both, since it is obvious you are wasting resources.</string>
    <string _locid="47465">You are confident to think you will not need your ally's help against my warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47466">You can build next to your ally's town. It will not help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47467">You must be very desperate now that your plans have been stopped.</string>
    <string _locid="47468">It makes me feel good to lift the yoke off my Native brothers.</string>
    <string _locid="47470">Another eyesore removed from the plains.</string>
    <string _locid="47471">I promise you an honorable death.</string>
    <string _locid="47472">It seems you think you are ready for a bigger challenge.</string>
    <string _locid="47473">It appears you are still stinging from the last time we played.</string>
    <string _locid="47474">I know these lands well. The advantage is mine.</string>
    <string _locid="47475">The bleeding you suffered last time seems to have taught you a lesson.</string>
    <string _locid="47476">You have much confidence, taking on a bigger enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="47477">Your braves cling so close to your war chief. They look scared to be outside your town.</string>
    <string _locid="47478">Your warriors seem to be lost. </string>
    <string _locid="47479">Come closer. My warriors do not want to travel far to slaughter your army.</string>
    <string _locid="47480">Coward! You kill women instead of my superior warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47481">That is an admirable force, but what good are soldiers without a leader?</string>
    <string _locid="47482">I see some children have wandered away from your camp. </string>
    <string _locid="47483">The spirits favor you with stealth.</string>
    <string _locid="47484">Some of your men are lost. Just like their chief.</string>
    <string _locid="47485">So that is where you plan to die.</string>
    <string _locid="47486">A valiant fight, but that is not yours to take.</string>
    <string _locid="47487">Watch how my warriors appear out of nowhere.</string>
    <string _locid="47488">Things are quiet out there. My warriors could be anywhere.</string>
    <string _locid="47489">I do not know how, but you were the better war chief today.</string>
    <string _locid="47490">You were lucky this time, but we will rebuild.</string>
    <string _locid="47491">Why do you continue to plead with Natives? Are your own soldiers so bad?</string>
    <string _locid="47492">You may have more trading posts, but that only means more glory for my warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47493">You have the speed of a bird, but your bones are just as brittle.</string>
    <string _locid="47494">No amount of treasure will keep my warriors out of your town.</string>
    <string _locid="47495">You are greedy, like all our enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47496">Eat that food quickly, you will soon be choking on my tomahawk.</string>
    <string _locid="47497">All the treasures in these lands will not keep me from spilling your blood.</string>
    <string _locid="47498">Your war chief is a long way from home. I hope he knows his way back.</string>
    <string _locid="47499">It won't be long before your Native allies have realized that they are on the wrong side.</string>
    <string _locid="47500">Keep those people safe, or they will become part of my tribe.</string>
    <string _locid="47501">No amount of wood will keep my warriors out of your town.</string>
    <string _locid="47503">My tribe grows while yours sits idle.</string>
    <string _locid="47504">See how quickly the influence of my people spreads across the land.</string>
    <string _locid="47505">The power of my people grows with every passing second.</string>
    <string _locid="47506">This wealth will buy many warriors. </string>
    <string _locid="47507">More food to feed my people.</string>
    <string _locid="47508">There is much treasure to be found around your base. I'm sure you don't want it.</string>
    <string _locid="47509">My treasures pile up, yet you have so few. Is something wrong?</string>
    <string _locid="47510">My tribe grows with more powerful warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47511">See how the people flock to my tribe.</string>
    <string _locid="47512">This wood will build many huts to house my warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47513">The locals here will soon learn that they have joined the wrong side. Do not count on their help.</string>
    <string _locid="47514">You waste your time and resources on ugly buildings. My people will burn them to the ground.</string>
    <string _locid="47515">You do not scare me with these tactics. My warriors will soon put an end to this.</string>
    <string _locid="47516">My tribe's influence is all over the map. You do not have the power to stop me.</string>
    <string _locid="47517">It would appear that another opponent has been drawing your blood. Now it is my turn.</string>
    <string _locid="47518">It seems you have been fighting less worthy opponents. Now I will give you a true lesson.</string>
    <string _locid="47519">You have been practicing, but wisely not against me.</string>
    <string _locid="47520">More sacrifices! The enemy is close to winning!</string>
    <string _locid="47521">Cuauhtemoc will play tlachtli with your head if he loses.</string>
    <string _locid="47522">Cuauhtemoc's treasure is not at the bottom of the lake. Pay no attention when he tells this to the enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="47523">The gods are pleased with the blood Cuauhtemoc has spilled for them. Victory will soon be ours.</string>
    <string _locid="47524">The mighty Aztecs do not need artillery. But you do.</string>
    <string _locid="47525">Unlike us, you will need siege weapons to destroy the foe. Build artillery.</string>
    <string _locid="47526">Train more cavalry. Cuauhtemoc's warriors like the strange, hornless deer.</string>
    <string _locid="47527">The mighty Aztecs run their enemies down on foot. But you must train cavalry if you wish to do the same.</string>
    <string _locid="47528">You waste blood in that fight - you need more infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="47529">The Aztec Empire is built on infantry and blood. Train more foot warriors. </string>
    <string _locid="47530">If you insist on sacrificing your warriors, please do so at the temple.</string>
    <string _locid="47531">Retreat -- you waste your warriors on the battlefield!</string>
    <string _locid="47532">The stones of the battlefield drink the life of your army. Run away until you are stronger.</string>
    <string _locid="47533">The battle you enter will be bloody, and while Cuauhtemoc relishes blood, he relishes victory more.</string>
    <string _locid="47534">Retreat, the gods are not nourished when your blood is spilt on the battlefield.</string>
    <string _locid="47535">Good, our enemies gather together so that we may slaughter them all at once.</string>
    <string _locid="47536">Let the blood of our warriors and our foes mix and nourish the gods.</string>
    <string _locid="47537">Cuauhtemoc has never garlanded so many so quickly.</string>
    <string _locid="47539">Cuauhtemoc has captured many enemies for sacrifice.</string>
    <string _locid="47540">An easy victory. More blood for the gods of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47541">Cuauhtemoc has turned defeat into triumph again!</string>
    <string _locid="47542">Our enemies were like the stars, but Cuauhtemoc waded through blood to earn his victory.</string>
    <string _locid="47543">The gods favor those who make sacrifice to them. Many lives were lost in that fight.</string>
    <string _locid="47544">That fight was too fast. Cuauhtemoc lacked time to capture sacrifices.</string>
    <string _locid="47545">Many went to the afterlife, but Cuauhtemoc prevailed.</string>
    <string _locid="47546">Cuauhtemoc will have many sacrifices after this battle.</string>
    <string _locid="47547">After Cuauhtemoc's victory, he celebrates!</string>
    <string _locid="47549">The pipiltin called Cuauhtemoc away for this?!</string>
    <string _locid="47550">Cuauhtemoc will crush our enemies in the coming battle.</string>
    <string _locid="47551">After the enemy throw themselves on Aztec blades, Cuauhtemoc will return to the temple.</string>
    <string _locid="47552">The battle turns. Cuauhtemoc thanks you.</string>
    <string _locid="47553">Cuauhtemoc is glad your army arrived. He was beginning to consider the knife for himself.</string>
    <string _locid="47554">They enemy bands together! They fear Cuauhtemoc - and they should!</string>
    <string _locid="47556">Cuauhtemoc shall.</string>
    <string _locid="47557">Yes.</string>
    <string _locid="47558">Of course.</string>
    <string _locid="47559">Cuauhtemoc agrees.</string>
    <string _locid="47560">Artillery? What is this 'artillery' you speak of?</string>
    <string _locid="47561">Cuauhtemoc will comply as best he can.</string>
    <string _locid="47562">What need have Aztecs for artillery? Cuauhtemoc will show you a different kind of 'artillery.'</string>
    <string _locid="47563">You joke with Cuauhtemoc, yes? The Aztecs ride no beasts.</string>
    <string _locid="47564">Cuauhtemoc will send his fastest warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47565">Cavalry? The Aztecs do not borrow the strength of beasts.</string>
    <string _locid="47566">Of course Cuauhtemoc will train infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="47567">Infantry? What else from the Aztecs?</string>
    <string _locid="47568">What else could Cuauhtemoc train except infantry?</string>
    <string _locid="47569">Cuauhtemoc does not like to share.</string>
    <string _locid="47570">Cuauhtemoc's people come first.</string>
    <string _locid="47571">Cuauhtemoc gives up nothing.</string>
    <string _locid="47572">Leave Cuauhtemoc alone.</string>
    <string _locid="47573">Rodents and worms have eaten our supplies. Dark times are ahead.</string>
    <string _locid="47574">Even Cuauhtemoc cannot do so.</string>
    <string _locid="47575">Ask Cuauhtemoc again in 52 years.</string>
    <string _locid="47576">Cuauhtemoc refuses.</string>
    <string _locid="47577">Cuauhtemoc's warriors labor in the fields... they cannot fight now.</string>
    <string _locid="47578">No warriors can be spared. Cuauhtemoc has... religious matters to attend to.</string>
    <string _locid="47579">There is unrest in the Empire. Cuauhtemoc can spare no warriors. </string>
    <string _locid="47580">This is prevented by happenings beyond even Cuauhtemoc's power.</string>
    <string _locid="47581">Cuauhtemoc would, but greater forces prevent it.</string>
    <string _locid="47582">The greater law does not allow Cuauhtemoc to do this.</string>
    <string _locid="47583">Cuauhtemoc's warriors have bled out their lives. Their corpses would be of little use to you.</string>
    <string _locid="47584">Cuauhtemoc does not have enough warriors to send.</string>
    <string _locid="47585">Ask again later, Cuauhtemoc may have soldiers for you then.</string>
    <string _locid="47586">Bah! They have destroyed a Trading Post. They will pay in blood!</string>
    <string _locid="47587">Close... so close.</string>
    <string _locid="47588">Soon the rebel Aztec leader will grovel at Cuauhtemoc's feet, begging for merciful death.</string>
    <string _locid="47589">We will grind the British into dust, like so much corn.</string>
    <string _locid="47590">Gold cannot save the Dutch from the wrath of Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47591">The French will find that Cuauhtemoc is merciless.</string>
    <string _locid="47592">The blood of Haudenosaunee warriors will soon redden the temple steps.</string>
    <string _locid="47593">Cuauhtemoc will feed the heaps of Ottoman corpses to his menagerie.</string>
    <string _locid="47594">Cuauhtemoc will crush the Portuguese!</string>
    <string _locid="47595">The Russian hordes could not hope to bear up under the might of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47597">The Spanish could never hope to defeat Emperor Cuauhtemoc and the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47598">These traitor Aztecs are stronger than Cuauhtemoc expected.</string>
    <string _locid="47599">Cuauhtemoc blames you for letting the British thrive.</string>
    <string _locid="47600">How did the Dutch become so powerful? Do they also make sacrifices to the gods?</string>
    <string _locid="47601">The French do well. Cuauhtemoc can not tolerate this.</string>
    <string _locid="47602">Who would expect such strength from the Germans? Not Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47603">The Haudenosaunee surprise Cuauhtemoc with their strength.</string>
    <string _locid="47604">The Ottomans are strong... it must be their coffee.</string>
    <string _locid="47605">The Portuguese are stronger than expected. Good, Cuauhtemoc needed a challenge.</string>
    <string _locid="47606">Cuauhtemoc has learned that the only thing worse than Russians are more Russians.</string>
    <string _locid="47608">Even when the Spanish are few, they are powerful.</string>
    <string _locid="47609">You advance quickly. Cuauhtemoc should not have lingered so long over his rituals.</string>
    <string _locid="47610">Cuauhtemoc must spill blood to catch up. Blood!</string>
    <string _locid="47611">Who are you to advance so quickly - a descendant of Quetzalcoatl?</string>
    <string _locid="47612">Our enemy seeks allies here. It will end badly. Trust Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47613">Alliances are fragile. Cuauhtemoc is not concerned that our enemy trusts in them.</string>
    <string _locid="47614">Cuauhtemoc trusts no one but himself. Let our enemy forge his foolish alliances.</string>
    <string _locid="47615">Our enemy has created an alliance for us to break.</string>
    <string _locid="47616">There are no warriors in the first Age. Warriors bring death. Death wins wars!</string>
    <string _locid="47617">You have spent long enough in the first Age.</string>
    <string _locid="47618">Advance in Age or be crushed like an overripe melon.</string>
    <string _locid="47619">You are too slow to be worthy of life. Advance or die.</string>
    <string _locid="47620">Advance in Age soon - Cuauhtemoc can carry you no longer.</string>
    <string _locid="47621">Soon it will be too late. Advance or die.</string>
    <string _locid="47622">If you have no use for your villagers, send them to Cuauhtemoc. He has ideas for them.</string>
    <string _locid="47623">Why are you so far behind Cuauhtemoc?</string>
    <string _locid="47624">You are too fast for us all. Cuauhtemoc is yet mired in the first Age.</string>
    <string _locid="47625">Be careful. He who rushes forward exposes his back.</string>
    <string _locid="47626">Good. Soon you will have many warriors to bring death to our enemies. You are training warriors, yes?</string>
    <string _locid="47627">The omens in the sky whisper of your greatness.</string>
    <string _locid="47628">You are the first to advance in Age. Now death shall reign among our foes.</string>
    <string _locid="47629">Finally you have caught up with Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47630">You had better not be so slow again. Cuauhtemoc cannot always protect you.</string>
    <string _locid="47631">You are slower than the sloth in Cuauhtemoc's menagerie.</string>
    <string _locid="47632">Finally. Does your heart beat as slowly as you advance in Age?</string>
    <string _locid="47633">Cuauhtemoc will make sacrifices in your name so you can advance in Age more quickly next time.</string>
    <string _locid="47634">Cuauhtemoc has saved us all. You are welcome.</string>
    <string _locid="47635">They are broken! Now Cuauhtemoc goes for the throat.</string>
    <string _locid="47636">No alliances! Cuauhtemoc does not allow them!</string>
    <string _locid="47637">Cuauhtemoc has broken the enemy Native alliance here.</string>
    <string _locid="47638">Now these Natives may consider an alliance with Cuauhtemoc. He would like that. Very much.</string>
    <string _locid="47639">Out! Out! Cuauhtemoc has chased the enemy from this village.</string>
    <string _locid="47640">Cuauhtemoc tastes the destruction...</string>
    <string _locid="47641">Cuauhtemoc reigns over this ruin in darkness and smoke.</string>
    <string _locid="47642">Smoke and fire! Our enemies flee Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47644">Cuauhtemoc's warriors dance in the rubble of our enemy's town. Slay them, my warriors! Slay!</string>
    <string _locid="47645">They shall not trade here anymore. So says Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47646">There can be no trade if Cuauhtemoc forbids it.</string>
    <string _locid="47647">Come! Build a Trading Post here. Cuauhtemoc commands it.</string>
    <string _locid="47648">Why did the enemy fools think that any would want the goods peddled here?</string>
    <string _locid="47649">If a building can be sacrificed, Cuauhtemoc has sacrificed this Trading Post.</string>
    <string _locid="47650">Bah... Cuauhtemoc could not destroy our enemy's alliance with this tribe. </string>
    <string _locid="47651">Cuauhtemoc must regroup to attack the Trading Post in the Native village again.</string>
    <string _locid="47652">Emperor Cuauhtemoc cannot be defeated... yet he was.</string>
    <string _locid="47653">Cuauhtemoc has discovered that our enemy's buildings are protected by dark magic.</string>
    <string _locid="47654">Unbelievable. This Trading Post somehow survived Cuauhtemoc's attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="47655">When will this Trading Post fall to the might of the Aztec Empire?</string>
    <string _locid="47656">What incompetence! Cuauhtemoc's war chief has fallen.</string>
    <string _locid="47657">Someone or something has slain Cuauhtemoc's war chief. The gods found him unworthy.</string>
    <string _locid="47658">The water is bitter. Our food is bitter. Nothing can save Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47659">Send an army here or you will find only gloriously-fallen Aztec corpses.</string>
    <string _locid="47660">The city is in flame. All is darkness and destruction. Can even you save Cuauhtemoc?</string>
    <string _locid="47661">Quick! Send your armies to Cuauhtemoc's city!</string>
    <string _locid="47662">Cuauhtemoc's city shall soon fall. When it does, your city may follow.</string>
    <string _locid="47663">I am Cuauhtemoc. Cuauhtemoc is the Aztec Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="47664">I am Emperor Cuauhtemoc. The Aztecs stand ready to conquer.</string>
    <string _locid="47665">Cuauhtemoc does not want to hear your cries when the enemies attack with fury in their hearts.</string>
    <string _locid="47666">Perhaps easier enemies shall be more to your taste. They certainly are to Cuauhtemoc's...</string>
    <string _locid="47667">How have you been since last we met? Since you crushed Cuauhtemoc's people under your heel.</string>
    <string _locid="47668">Cuauhtemoc bows before no one save the gods... are you their messenger?</string>
    <string _locid="47669">Hmmm... Cuauhtemoc wonders if you will be better now than when last we met.</string>
    <string _locid="47670">Cuauhtemoc can not carry you this time. Stand on your own or die.</string>
    <string _locid="47671">We do like battling here, don't we?</string>
    <string _locid="47672">The blood spilled this time had better not be Cuauhtemoc's.</string>
    <string _locid="47673">Once more we bring battle and bloodshed to our enemies! Death!</string>
    <string _locid="47674">My war chief has returned, like Quetzalcoatl. But without the fangs. Or feathers. Or divinity.</string>
    <string _locid="47676">Cuauhtemoc sees no army in the enemy city. Perhaps they have all been fed to the gods?</string>
    <string _locid="47677">The enemy has not built any barracks... either they are foolish or they have built it elsewhere. Cuauhtemoc suspects they are foolish.</string>
    <string _locid="47678">There is no barracks here. Why anyone would not want Infantry mystifies Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47679">The scouts of Cuauhtemoc have found no stable. Our enemy may have given up on the strange horse-beasts.</string>
    <string _locid="47680">Cuauhtemoc sees no stable. Good. Those 'horses' make Cuauhtemoc... nervous.</string>
    <string _locid="47681">Take this gold. Do not waste it.</string>
    <string _locid="47682">Do not waste this gold.</string>
    <string _locid="47683">Gold from the coffers of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47684">Gold, jade, and furs. These will bring you Coin.</string>
    <string _locid="47685">This tribute is backwards. You should be sending Coin to Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47686">Grain, fruit and cocoa for Cuauhtemoc's friend.</string>
    <string _locid="47687">Cuauhtemoc has sent you a treat - the flesh of captured warriors. Ha! Cuauhtemoc makes a joke!</string>
    <string _locid="47688">A gift of food. Could you spare a villager to assist in a teeny-tiny sacrifice that Cuauhtemoc needs to make? A small one will do.</string>
    <string _locid="47689">Cuauhtemoc is unaccustomed to sending tribute. Here - take your filthy food.</string>
    <string _locid="47690">Take these animal carcasses. They are bled dry.</string>
    <string _locid="47691">Here is some wood. Cuauhtemoc builds in stone.</string>
    <string _locid="47692">Here is some wood. Carve Cuauhtemoc a mask. What? You use it for buildings? For weapons? What a waste.</string>
    <string _locid="47693">What need does Cuauhtemoc have of mere Wood? Take it.</string>
    <string _locid="47694">After you get this wood, have your carpenters make a tzompantli so you may display your skulls.</string>
    <string _locid="47695">Wood for your fires and your buildings. But especially your fires!</string>
    <string _locid="47696">Cuauhtemoc's heart beats strongly - he marches to war!</string>
    <string _locid="47697">Cuauhtemoc will capture many for sacrifice after the coming battle.</string>
    <string _locid="47698">Cuauhtemoc can already hear the screaming... </string>
    <string _locid="47699">Aztec muscle will flatten this base as if it had never been.</string>
    <string _locid="47700">Watch the settlers flee... run settlers run! You cannot escape the knife of Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47701">There will be nothing but smoldering grass and rubble when Cuauhtemoc is done with the enemy's town.</string>
    <string _locid="47702">Aztec thews will reduce the enemy's town to rubble. And its people to corpses - or captives!</string>
    <string _locid="47703">Cuauhtemoc no longer suffers the alliance of this minor tribe with our enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47704">Burn! Burn! There can be no trade without Cuauhtemoc's consent. Burn!</string>
    <string _locid="47705">Cuauhtemoc does not trust your wisdom, but he shall fight alongside you.</string>
    <string _locid="47706">Cuauhtemoc thinks your ranks look a little thin. His warriors will come to fill them out.</string>
    <string _locid="47707">Cuauhtemoc does not want to miss the coming bloodshed. Wait for his army!</string>
    <string _locid="47708">The Aztec armies will group here. Get out of the way.</string>
    <string _locid="47709">The walls of Tenochtitlan are bursting... Cuauhtemoc is founding a new city.</string>
    <string _locid="47710">Begin the songs and music to bless the new city of the Aztecs!</string>
    <string _locid="47711">I shall make a great ritual! My new city can not bless itself!</string>
    <string _locid="47712">Though he has been burned in the past, Cuauhtemoc shall attempt an alliance with the Natives here.</string>
    <string _locid="47713">Cuauhtemoc will speak with these Natives. If they do not agree to ally with him he shall slay... er... he means that he will ask again, nicely.</string>
    <string _locid="47714">Cocoa, fine cloth, precious metals... sacrificial animals... all for sale at this new Trading Post.</string>
    <string _locid="47715">Cuauhtemoc thinks it is time the world beheld the splendors of the Aztecs. He shall construct a Trading Post.</string>
    <string _locid="47716">Cuauhtemoc's soldiers shall defend this building. Or die trying.</string>
    <string _locid="47717">Cuauhtemoc will defend this building no matter how many lives it costs.</string>
    <string _locid="47718">Cuauhtemoc will hold this area for 52 years!</string>
    <string _locid="47719">Cuauhtemoc's warriors shall fight here. They shall die here. Cuauhtemoc himself shall die here if he must.</string>
    <string _locid="47720">Cuauhtemoc fights for this alliance. These Natives have proven loyal. Their hearts are strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47721">Cuauhtemoc shall not let the enemy sabotage his alliance with these Natives.</string>
    <string _locid="47722">The enemy shall not set foot into this town until the last of Cuauhtemoc's warriors are dead.</string>
    <string _locid="47723">Cuauhtemoc shall defend this town until the sun no longer rises.</string>
    <string _locid="47724">Mighty Cuauhtemoc does not need the goods traded here, but he shall not deprive you of them.</string>
    <string _locid="47725">This Trading Post shall stand. So says Cuauhtemoc, Lord of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47726">Coin? Take it. What do the gods care for gold? They want lives!</string>
    <string _locid="47727">My people, we will send gold to our ally. So says Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="47728">Warriors toiled long in the fields for this food. Do not waste what Cuauhtemoc sends you.</string>
    <string _locid="47729">The chinampas overflow with food. Cuauhtemoc shall send you his leftovers.</string>
    <string _locid="47730">Cuauhtemoc requires little Wood. You may have what he does not need.</string>
    <string _locid="47731">Cuauhtemoc's people will be cold tonight.</string>
    <string _locid="47732">Cuauhtemoc's warriors rush to battle. The thunder you hear is their feet!</string>
    <string _locid="47733">Cuauhtemoc sends all the warriors he can spare!</string>
    <string _locid="47734">So many sacrifices, so little time.</string>
    <string _locid="47735">If you had to choose between your own life and the sun never rising again, which would you choose? Cuauhtemoc is not evil. He allows others to be selfless.</string>
    <string _locid="47736">Come to the next renewal ceremony, Cuauhtemoc will  spare no expense to ... entertain you.</string>
    <string _locid="47737">Sometimes Cuauhtemoc imagines that he controls little men, no bigger than his thumb. He makes them scurry and fight and die. Cuauhtemoc needs to lay off the Ololiuhqui.</string>
    <string _locid="47738">Cuauhtemoc needs gold. Send Cuauhtemoc coin!</string>
    <string _locid="47739">Send Cuauhtemoc whatever coin you feel he is worthy of. He will not be at all angry if it is too little ... not angry at all...</string>
    <string _locid="47740">Food... Cuauhtemoc hungers!</string>
    <string _locid="47741">Food! Cuauhtemoc demands a feast of food!</string>
    <string _locid="47742">Cuauhtemoc needs wood to build a fire on the chest of a warrior sacrifice.</string>
    <string _locid="47743">Cuauhtemoc needs wood to burn sacrifices-- er... to build buildings and weapons.</string>
    <string _locid="47744">Cuauhtemoc is grateful for your help in slaying our hated enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="47745">Cuauhtemoc had the situation well in hand. He needed no help.</string>
    <string _locid="47746">Cuauhtemoc did not ask for your help.</string>
    <string _locid="47747">Cuauhtemoc shall not waste this gift of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="47748">This food shall nourish Cuauhtemoc's people. Cuauhtemoc thanks you.</string>
    <string _locid="47749">The Aztec people are grateful for your assistance.</string>
    <string _locid="47750">Finally you arrive. If you had not shown up when you did, Cuauhtemoc would have been finished.</string>
    <string _locid="47751">Cuauhtemoc did not need your warriors. But since they have marched so far it would be a shame for them to leave.</string>
    <string _locid="47752">Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the mighty Aztecs, thanks you for your fitting tribute.</string>
    <string _locid="47753">Ahh.... Good. This wood will burn in the hearths of the Aztecs. The fire god will be pleased. </string>
    <string _locid="47754">No! It can't be! No traitor Aztec chieftain could defeat Emperor Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47755">Bah! The British! Cuauhtemoc spits on them!</string>
    <string _locid="47756">These Dutch, they are not all about Banks and trade...</string>
    <string _locid="47757">Cuauhtemoc hopes the French are as merciful as they are strong.</string>
    <string _locid="47758">How could we stop the Germans? Their uhlans run amuck!</string>
    <string _locid="47759">Cuauhtemoc fears that the Haudenosaunee have more surprises in store.</string>
    <string _locid="47760">Strong artillery. Strong infantry. Even strong coffee! The Ottomans are unstoppable.</string>
    <string _locid="47761">The Portuguese crush us... Cuauhtemoc did not seek this much challenge.</string>
    <string _locid="47762">We are doomed by relentless Russians. </string>
    <string _locid="47764">Who would have expected the Spanish to defeat the Aztecs so easily?</string>
    <string _locid="47765">No! Cuauhtemoc refuses to believe his pathetic Aztec rival is beating him! It is not so!</string>
    <string _locid="47766">Cuauhtemoc has made sacrifice after sacrifice. And still the weak British prevail.</string>
    <string _locid="47767">How do the Dutch defeat Cuauhtemoc?</string>
    <string _locid="47768">The French are winning. The only answer to this humiliation is blood! More blood!</string>
    <string _locid="47769">Cuauhtemoc must not allow the Germans a victory. Though it may be out of his hands.</string>
    <string _locid="47770">The Haudenosaunee slaughter us. Cuauhtemoc is unaccustomed to being on the pointy end of the knife.</string>
    <string _locid="47771">If the Ottomans were more powerful they could end this now. Instead they make Cuauhtemoc linger.</string>
    <string _locid="47772">How! How can the Portuguese beat us? With numbers? With gunpowder? Hmm ... that is probably it.</string>
    <string _locid="47773">The Russians drown us, but how? Cuauhtemoc blames you.</string>
    <string _locid="47775">No! The Spanish are so few! How could they possibly defeat Cuauhtemoc?</string>
    <string _locid="47776">Cuauhtemoc can stomach no more blood. Cuauhtemoc is so funny. He loves blood. But we are losing.</string>
    <string _locid="47777">We are losing. How can a king be as weak as you?</string>
    <string _locid="47778">Blood flows down the temple steps! We are winning!</string>
    <string _locid="47779">Cuauhtemoc has concealed his power well. Now the victory seems like your doing. No thanks necessary.</string>
    <string _locid="47780">This victory is Cuauhtemoc's, but you may bask in his reflected glory.</string>
    <string _locid="47781">Come with Cuauhtemoc to the temple. It is time to end this war.</string>
    <string _locid="47782">Emperor Cuauhtemoc wishes to end it. The obsidian knife is ready. </string>
    <string _locid="47783">Cuauhtemoc can fight no longer. He will be unsuitable for sacrifice if the fighting continues.</string>
    <string _locid="47784">What will convince you to stop? Should Cuauhtemoc hand you the obsidian knife?</string>
    <string _locid="47785">Look - a glowing ear of corn in the sky - it sheds sparks like drops of blood... this is a sign. It is over.</string>
    <string _locid="47786">Cowards! They fear to face Cuauhtemoc's armies at the time of his choosing.</string>
    <string _locid="47787">The enemy allies with the Natives here. Cuauhtemoc cannot allow this.</string>
    <string _locid="47788">Cuauhtemoc refuses to let the enemy monopolize trade here.</string>
    <string _locid="47789">They build alliances with the Natives. They are out after Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47790">Good. Cuauhtemoc's foes are denied that tribe's loyalty.</string>
    <string _locid="47791">Bah, why bother with Trading Posts?</string>
    <string _locid="47792">Your first treasure. Take it as Cuauhtemoc's gift.</string>
    <string _locid="47793">Cuauhtemoc thinks you are out to get all the treasures... yes... all the treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="47794">Cuauhtemoc could have used that coin.</string>
    <string _locid="47795">Cuauhtemoc could have used that food.</string>
    <string _locid="47796">Fine! Take all the treasures! Leave none for Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47797">Thief! You steal from Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47798">When you have no more use of that Native, send him to Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47799">Villagers? Take them. Cuauhtemoc wants warriors. </string>
    <string _locid="47800">Cuauhtemoc could use that wood.</string>
    <string _locid="47801">The more Native tribes we ally with, the fewer our enemies have to turn against us.</string>
    <string _locid="47802">Cuauhtemoc hopes that you spending resources on your army too. Fruits and blankets make poor weapons.</string>
    <string _locid="47803">Walls? Do you fear Cuauhtemoc?</string>
    <string _locid="47804">Cuauhtemoc hopes that you have enough wood to train warriors after building that wall.</string>
    <string _locid="47805">Cuauhtemoc cannot leave the Natives here to ally with his enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47806">The mighty Aztecs share their goods with the world.</string>
    <string _locid="47807">Cuauhtemoc finds treasure in the wilderness.</string>
    <string _locid="47808">Tribute for Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47809">More tribute for Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47810">This treasure in your town must be tribute for Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47811">All the treasures of the wilderness are tribute to Cuauhtemoc and the Aztecs!</string>
    <string _locid="47812">Cuauhtemoc has rescued a Native, who will make a fine scout.</string>
    <string _locid="47813">Cuauhtemoc has rescued villagers...hist! Cuauhtemoc can hear their beating hearts.</string>
    <string _locid="47814">This wood will make fine maquahuitl.</string>
    <string _locid="47815">Cuauhtemoc cares not for alliances, but better Cuauhtemoc than his enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="47816">Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs, Master of Trade!</string>
    <string _locid="47817">Walls... the better to keep Cuauhtemoc's people safe.</string>
    <string _locid="47818">We will win if enough time passes - Cuauhtemoc shall begin offering hearts to the gods for our victory!</string>
    <string _locid="47819">No defeat is so great that it cannot be washed away by blood. </string>
    <string _locid="47820">Cuauhtemoc sees you have won battles since we met. He celebrates with a sacrifice!</string>
    <string _locid="47821">You grow more experienced with each battle. Cuauhtemoc offers thanks to the gods.</string>
    <string _locid="47822">One of these Trading Posts must fall!</string>
    <string _locid="47823">Cuauhtemoc will feed your souls to the hungry gods.</string>
    <string _locid="47824">Blood! More blood!</string>
    <string _locid="47825">Cuauhtemoc was wrong about you. You would make a fine sacrifice.</string>
    <string _locid="47826">Bah! Sacrifice at the temple is one thing, but on the battlefield...</string>
    <string _locid="47827">Cuauhtemoc cannot lose! This must be an evil dream sent by the gods. </string>
    <string _locid="47828">You are no challenge to mighty Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47829">Cuauhtemoc can feel the blood of your people running down his arms already.</string>
    <string _locid="47830">You waste Cuauhtemoc's time!</string>
    <string _locid="47831">What made you think that battle was a good idea?</string>
    <string _locid="47832">Prepare yourself for death.</string>
    <string _locid="47833">Cuauhtemoc asks... do you prefer a slow death or a swift one?</string>
    <string _locid="47834">You may flee... Cuauhtemoc is not without mercy. Who is Cuauhtemoc kidding?</string>
    <string _locid="47835">Your warriors have turned the battle. Cuauhtemoc wonders what you shall demand for your help.</string>
    <string _locid="47836">Cuauhtemoc's enemies band together. They fear him!</string>
    <string _locid="47837">Rush headlong into death! Cuauhtemoc awaits.</string>
    <string _locid="47838">What? Already you advance in Age! This displeases Cuauhtemoc very much.</string>
    <string _locid="47839">Bah... Cuauhtemoc does not fear you, why should he fear your allies?</string>
    <string _locid="47840">Do not think you can turn these Natives against Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47841">This town is destroyed, but Cuauhtemoc will find another lake and another cactus and another snake-eating eagle.</string>
    <string _locid="47842">Cuauhtemoc did not need that Trading Post.</string>
    <string _locid="47843">Are your people too frightened of Cuauhtemoc to advance in Age?</string>
    <string _locid="47844">You are still in the first Age? Perhaps Cuauhtemoc will ensure you never see the second one.</string>
    <string _locid="47845">Cuauhtemoc wonders why you cling to such primitive ways.</string>
    <string _locid="47846">Cuauhtemoc's warriors are stronger than yours. His farms are more productive. His carpenters are more skilled. What hope do you have?</string>
    <string _locid="47847">When you rush ahead, Cuauhtemoc has a good shot at your back.</string>
    <string _locid="47848">Young corn grows quickly. Cuauhtemoc will cut you down.</string>
    <string _locid="47849">Welcome to the wars. This is the Age where Cuauhtemoc will begin to destroy you.</string>
    <string _locid="47850">Aha! Cuauhtemoc told his ally you were still here. His ally did not believe him.</string>
    <string _locid="47851">Your town is far from everyone else... no one can hear your screams...</string>
    <string _locid="47852">Bah! After he crushes your town Cuauhtemoc has a long walk to destroy your allies.</string>
    <string _locid="47853">Ah... good. After Cuauhtemoc destroys your town he will not have far to march to finish your ally.</string>
    <string _locid="47854">Try again and fail - again! So says Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47855">Cuauhtemoc cannot suffer these alliances to exist.</string>
    <string _locid="47857">None may trade without Cuauhtemoc's say.</string>
    <string _locid="47858">I am Cuauhtemoc, Lord of all Aztecs. And you are not Quetzalcoatl.</string>
    <string _locid="47859">Ahhh...It is a fine day for Emperor Cuauhtemoc to nourish the gods by sacrificing your warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47860">Kneel before Emperor Cuauhtemoc and he will let you choose the manner of your own death.</string>
    <string _locid="47861">I am Cuauhtemoc, Emperor of the Aztecs. Cuauhtemoc will enjoy placing your skull in the tzompantli.</string>
    <string _locid="47863">It is good to admit weakness. Perhaps you should just hand yourself over to Cuauhtemoc for sacrifice right now.</string>
    <string _locid="47864">You must enjoy spilling your blood in this land. So does Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47865">Stacking the odds in your favor? Cuauhtemoc sees that your efforts are fruitless.</string>
    <string _locid="47866">What? Cuauhtemoc was not enough of a challenge? He does not need a new ally to defeat the likes of you!</string>
    <string _locid="47867">Cuauhtemoc's war chief returns. He lusts for vengeance.</string>
    <string _locid="47868">You will not gather many treasures with him.</string>
    <string _locid="47869">Cuauhtemoc has spotted your warriors. The gods thirst for their blood.</string>
    <string _locid="47870">No, no, the temple is over here. Attack near it so Cuauhtemoc will not have far to drag the bodies.</string>
    <string _locid="47871">Why do your warriors attack Cuauhtemoc? Has some war begun he did not know about?</string>
    <string _locid="47872">No one spills the blood of Cuauhtemoc's people except Cuauhtemoc!</string>
    <string _locid="47873">Cuauhtemoc sees you have come to negotiate your surrender.</string>
    <string _locid="47874">This army is too small to conquer me, but almost too large to capture for sacrifice. Almost. </string>
    <string _locid="47875">Your warriors scurry like insects in Cuauhtemoc's' city. Ow! Stinging insects!</string>
    <string _locid="47876">The blood of so few can only cause the sun to rise for a week or two. Send more. </string>
    <string _locid="47878">Cuauhtemoc seeeeees yoooou.</string>
    <string _locid="47879">It is good of you to leave tribute for Cuauhtemoc. He will make your death as painless as he can.</string>
    <string _locid="47880">Cuauhtemoc cannot resist warning you of his attack so he may smell the fear in your sweat.</string>
    <string _locid="47881">That thunder? It is the blood rushing in your ears that you hear.</string>
    <string _locid="47882">The Aztec army comes. Surrender so that Cuauhtemoc can more easily take you to the waiting altar. </string>
    <string _locid="47883">Blood is power.</string>
    <string _locid="47884">A sign glows in the sky, an ear of corn shedding sparks like blood.</string>
    <string _locid="47885">There is always room for sacrifice.</string>
    <string _locid="47886">Cuauhtemoc concedes. The treasure of the Aztecs is at the bottom of the lake. </string>
    <string _locid="47887">Give Cuauhtemoc an honorable death so that his blood may nourish the gods and his flesh feed your menagerie.</string>
    <string _locid="47888">Come! End it!</string>
    <string _locid="47889">Before you cut down Cuauhtemoc's people, would you care to share a cup of chocolate?</string>
    <string _locid="47890">Burn the bridges! Pour the treasure into the lake! The Aztecs are finished.</string>
    <string _locid="47891">No! Cuauhtemoc will never surrender! Unless you let him...</string>
    <string _locid="47892">Cuauhtemoc did not shed enough blood to ensure victory. It is the end of all things.</string>
    <string _locid="47893">The Aztecs are defeated. Will the sun ever rise again?</string>
    <string _locid="47894">Cuauhtemoc underestimated your stubborn nature.</string>
    <string _locid="47896">Scurry, scurry! Grab the treasures...</string>
    <string _locid="47897">Those treasures cannot save you from Cuauhtemoc's obsidian blade.</string>
    <string _locid="47898">You amass wealth. All the more for Cuauhtemoc when he conquers you.</string>
    <string _locid="47899">Yes, fatten yourselves up.</string>
    <string _locid="47900">Your collection of treasures may comfort you in the grave.</string>
    <string _locid="47901">Cuauhtemoc will enjoy making you pay for stealing that treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="47902">Be careful of treachery from those you protect.</string>
    <string _locid="47904">Gathering wood for your funeral pyre?</string>
    <string _locid="47905">Cuauhtemoc sees a wall. You are properly frightened.</string>
    <string _locid="47906">No wall can save you from Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47907">The Aztecs are well known for their alliances with neighboring peoples.</string>
    <string _locid="47908">Cuauhtemoc claims all trade in this land.</string>
    <string _locid="47909">This land is ripe with treasures that belong to Emperor Cuauhtemoc.</string>
    <string _locid="47910">Mine!</string>
    <string _locid="47911">Glittering treasure!</string>
    <string _locid="47912">Cuauhtemoc hungers.</string>
    <string _locid="47913">Cuauhtemoc sees all. Steals all.</string>
    <string _locid="47914">Cuauhtemoc laughs at your sluggish treasure gathering.</string>
    <string _locid="47915">Cuauhtemoc loves the Natives of this land.</string>
    <string _locid="47916">These villagers are hearty. They will work hard.</string>
    <string _locid="47917">A cache of wood, the better to burn you with!</string>
    <string _locid="47918">In Cuauhtemoc's experience, such alliances can be deadly. Enjoy!</string>
    <string _locid="47919">A Trade Post. Now Cuauhtemoc knows where to find you.</string>
    <string _locid="47920">If you cannot defeat the mighty Aztecs on the battlefield, why do you think this will work?</string>
    <string _locid="47921">Good, my warriors like a challenge. It gets the blood up.</string>
    <string _locid="47922">Cuauhtemoc's victory is immanent. If you surrender now, you will have the honor to be the first at the altar. </string>
    <string _locid="47923">Cuauhtemoc opens the gates to his city so you may view its splendor as you die.</string>
    <string _locid="47924">Cuauhtemoc thinks that perhaps you have been seeking treasure at the bottom of a lake.</string>
    <string _locid="47925">You climb the steps to glory. Cuauhtemoc waits at the top.</string>
    <string _locid="47926">Do not imagine that Cuauhtemoc will cower just because you are more powerful than when he last faced you.</string>
    <string _locid="47927">Fear for us, O ally. Harm and evil come now near us!</string>
    <string _locid="47928">Better were it to go fasting than to bear this dreadful burden - we stand to lose in less than one minute.</string>
    <string _locid="47929">A monstrous story; we are but one minute from losing this war.</string>
    <string _locid="47930">Do not fear for me, O ally. Harm and evil shall come no more near us!</string>
    <string _locid="47931">By the shining water and the drifting grass lands, we shall win in less than one minute.</string>
    <string _locid="47932">From my brain the thought of vengeance, but from my heart the simple need for more siege.</string>
    <string _locid="47933">It would be a great achievement if you could bring more siege weapons to this battle.</string>
    <string _locid="47934">In these days of evil spirits, the fields of battle need more horsemen from you.</string>
    <string _locid="47935">We fight onward, in solemn manner, and need from you more horsed warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47936">When I speak to the foe he trembles, the need in battle is for more foot warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="47937">Our war clubs are swinging, our foes are cracking, but to win the war we need more foot warriors from you.</string>
    <string _locid="47938">You are like a man from a dream awakened, only to face a terrible blow. Withdraw, my ally, withdraw.</string>
    <string _locid="47939">The shattered sky above us breaks! Do not join us in this doomed fight, my ally!</string>
    <string _locid="47940">A battle rages. The sky we tread beneath bends and throws itself in fury.</string>
    <string _locid="47941">We join and raise our fists against the heavens; a great battle rages here!</string>
    <string _locid="47942">The clouds are swept from heaven. By our hand the enemy has passed from the fields, as we expected.</string>
    <string _locid="47943">The tens and eights of our enemy have fallen in that battle, as I knew they would.</string>
    <string _locid="47944">We threw them on the ground before us, our foes in rows vanquished. </string>
    <string _locid="47945">A moody melancholy takes me, with this victory that once seemed unlikely.</string>
    <string _locid="47946">Curious eyes stare about us. How did we win that battle, which should have been a loss?</string>
    <string _locid="47947">In many games of skill and hazard, one would have to reach far to find a battle like this one. How did we win it?</string>
    <string _locid="47948">Mighty move our forces, our foe's heart shall be swept with ice.</string>
    <string _locid="47949">I enter this fray full of eagerness.</string>
    <string _locid="47950">This battle will be excellent, full of victory for us and defeat for them.</string>
    <string _locid="47951">We shall circle our foes with confidence. They shall lose this fight.</string>
    <string _locid="47952">Timely and potent your arrival. The tide of battle flows now in our favor.</string>
    <string _locid="47953">It is good you are back from your wanderings; you are needed to turn the flow of this battle.</string>
    <string _locid="47954">Enters through the door a burning firebrand; another foe has joined the fray.</string>
    <string _locid="47955">The enemy has seized the war club in this fray; we may fare poorly.</string>
    <string _locid="47956">Ay, we shall.</string>
    <string _locid="47957">This is where we agree, yes.</string>
    <string _locid="47958">On my nation, on my honor, yes.</string>
    <string _locid="47959">Ay, though panting under heavy burdens.</string>
    <string _locid="47960">Ay, the forges shall fire, the siege made.</string>
    <string _locid="47961">I shall build the siege weapons you need, ally.</string>
    <string _locid="47962">Ay, our horse riders shall tread, and the grasses bend.</string>
    <string _locid="47963">You shout for horse riders, and horse riders I shall give you!</string>
    <string _locid="47964">Beneath shaggy eyebrows, I gaze. Your horse riders are on their way.</string>
    <string _locid="47965">Ay, although to the land of ghosts and shadows they may walk, foot warriors we shall train.</string>
    <string _locid="47966">The foot warriors shall journey to your side.</string>
    <string _locid="47967">Yes. And loosely shall our foes be scattered, when my foot warriors arrive to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47968">Our supplies and resources are little more than smoke wreaths. I cannot comply.</string>
    <string _locid="47969">My reserves are too low to meet your need, ally.</string>
    <string _locid="47970">I have not the food, wood, nor coin to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47971">To your request, we cannot accede.</string>
    <string _locid="47972">The fallen leaves of last year... No.</string>
    <string _locid="47973">That shall not be possible.</string>
    <string _locid="47974">Nay. We cannot.</string>
    <string _locid="47975">Have your eyes been blinded by the dark and bright? I have no warriors to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47976">You must find strength within. I lack an army to help you.</string>
    <string _locid="47977">Alas. I cannot. Better were it to go fasting than to bear such a heavy burden. </string>
    <string _locid="47978">Although the eyes of wolves glare at me, I cannot do that.</string>
    <string _locid="47979">My response must be lacking.</string>
    <string _locid="47980">My young soldiers are insufficient in number to meet your request.</string>
    <string _locid="47981">My forces are too depleted. No.</string>
    <string _locid="47982">I have too few warriors to help you now.</string>
    <string _locid="47983">Enemies have journeyed to one of our trading posts. It is laid to waste.</string>
    <string _locid="47984">We cannot win that way after all.</string>
    <string _locid="47985">The Aztecs have traveled a long and weary journey, but it looks now finally to be at a dark end.</string>
    <string _locid="47986">The Aztecs have almost been destroyed.</string>
    <string _locid="47987">Not so long and wide the world is... my wrath has reached the British empire!</string>
    <string _locid="47988">The British are almost gone, as ducks in the winter.</string>
    <string _locid="47989">If the powerful Dutch go on thus, we shall tear them to pieces.</string>
    <string _locid="47990">With fiery eyes and screaming, the Dutch fall before our war hatchets.</string>
    <string _locid="47991">For days the French have journeyed the pathways of the dead, and now they have reached their end.</string>
    <string _locid="47992">The French fought as well as they could, but are nearly lost.</string>
    <string _locid="47993">The Germans are almost gone to the land of ghosts and shadows.</string>
    <string _locid="47994">Their leadership in tatters, the Germans crumble before us.</string>
    <string _locid="47995">We see before us the false Haudenosaunee, their warpath broken before them. They are all but defeated.</string>
    <string _locid="47996">Our false Haudenosaunee foes are forced to the edge. They cannot fight much longer.</string>
    <string _locid="47997">The Ottoman foe passes now, heavy laden under our blows.</string>
    <string _locid="47998">The ravens tell me that nothing the Ottomans can do will save them now.</string>
    <string _locid="47999">The Portuguese tread the solitary path to defeat and ruin by our hand.</string>
    <string _locid="48000">Our Portuguese foe is falling. Soon his form will mingle with the crushed grass.</string>
    <string _locid="48001">Slowly vanish the Russian foes to the land of the hereafter.</string>
    <string _locid="48002">The Russians appear to have lost the war here. </string>
    <string _locid="48003">The earth shall be covered with silence; our foes are almost done with.</string>
    <string _locid="48005">To our Spanish foe lies now only a pathway to the lonely end.</string>
    <string _locid="48006">I see that the Spanish are doomed.</string>
    <string _locid="48007">How much power they bring to bear, the Aztec empire is thunder upon the soil.</string>
    <string _locid="48008">My eyes watch with awe. The Aztecs are a mighty foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48009">If outrageous Britain goes on thus, tearing everything to pieces, what becomes of us?</string>
    <string _locid="48010">It is a wonder that any nation has stood against our powerful British foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48011">Never stoops the soaring Dutch bird, mighty of wing and sword.</string>
    <string _locid="48012">The Dutch have a strength on the battlefield like a mountain bear.</string>
    <string _locid="48013">Disasters come not singly. The first descends from the French, but others will follow.</string>
    <string _locid="48014">A hawk with talons sharp and strong, the French descend with force most awesome.</string>
    <string _locid="48015">The powerful Germans have pressed us as if stooping over a ground bird's nest.</string>
    <string _locid="48016">We dare not taunt or provoke our German foe until we have grown as strong ourselves.</string>
    <string _locid="48017">Ever wakeful, ever watchful, the Haudenosaunee warriors seem mightier than the trees.</string>
    <string _locid="48018">The Haudenosaunee empire is mighty on the lands, moving like a strong river through the woods.</string>
    <string _locid="48019">There are corpses clad in garments, ghosts that come to haunt us. The Ottoman are a mighty foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48020">The Ottoman foe has great power in these lands. We dare not fight them too soon.</string>
    <string _locid="48021">We are thrown down before them. The Portuguese may tramp over our downed weapons with ease.</string>
    <string _locid="48022">The Portuguese are fierce sea hawks. They are not to be trifled with.</string>
    <string _locid="48023">The Russians laugh like water, their power in war rolls over the earth.</string>
    <string _locid="48024">Our foe from Russia has mighty hordes. Perhaps more than we can answer.</string>
    <string _locid="48027">We strove to seize the finest land, but the Spanish press back and may win the day.</string>
    <string _locid="48028">The Spanish have great strength. Let us not be blinded to this truth.</string>
    <string _locid="48029">I endure in silence, as you journey up the ages ahead of me.</string>
    <string _locid="48030">You have climbed the great tree of time, advancing well before I could.</string>
    <string _locid="48031">Our enemy claims the rights of guest and stranger in these lands, taking a Native settlement.</string>
    <string _locid="48032">Our enemy has gone like fog off the water, and claimed a Native ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48035">Do not weep in the silent midnight, instead make haste and advance to the next age.</string>
    <string _locid="48036">Stop drifting on the stream of time and advance to the next age.</string>
    <string _locid="48041">Henceforward and forever, I shall speak to the winds my thanks to you.</string>
    <string _locid="48042">I cry aloud and speak like sunlight: you have rescued my war chief.</string>
    <string _locid="48043">I have moved heavily upon their trading post in time.</string>
    <string _locid="48044">The enemy were a threat, but I have torn their plans to bits.</string>
    <string _locid="48045">The trading post in the Native village has been struck down. Forthwith and forever.</string>
    <string _locid="48046">My warriors have struck. An enemy Native village has fallen like an dead tree.</string>
    <string _locid="48047">See the masses of the enemy, lying still in their valley. </string>
    <string _locid="48048">Dust and broken arrows alone remain, in the enemy town I have just visited.</string>
    <string _locid="48049">An enemy trading post has been destroyed, souls sent upon their journey.</string>
    <string _locid="48050">Hear me ally. I have crushed a trading post of our hated foes.</string>
    <string _locid="48051">The trading post at the Native village still stands, although our outrage moved upon it.</string>
    <string _locid="48052">The enemy was too strong. I could not invade that Native village.</string>
    <string _locid="48053">We did fail in the lesser trial; the enemy town still stands.</string>
    <string _locid="48054">We ran to ambush the enemy town, but we were forced back.</string>
    <string _locid="48055">I report to you news unpopular; the enemy trading post stands yet.</string>
    <string _locid="48056">My warriors moved with heat and silence but were unable to strike down that enemy trading post.</string>
    <string _locid="48057">Night approaches, let a grave be kindled. My war chief is dead.</string>
    <string _locid="48058">I cannot capture treasures from the wilderness without my war chief.</string>
    <string _locid="48059">A guardian in the wilderness has killed my war chief.</string>
    <string _locid="48060">My war chief has fallen early, defeated by a creature of the wilderness.</string>
    <string _locid="48061">I faint in the harder struggle, feel a looming darkness over our hope.</string>
    <string _locid="48062">The cold breath of fate flies to us. I cannot see how we can win.</string>
    <string _locid="48063">My warriors need help in this place.</string>
    <string _locid="48064">I need help in the distance. Here.</string>
    <string _locid="48065">I see my nation scattered, forgetful of my counsels. I plead my ally's help.</string>
    <string _locid="48066">Enemies swarm like bees in my town; too many to fight without help.</string>
    <string _locid="48067">I am as a guest in your wigwam, my ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48068">Greetings. We shall rise in power together, like the new moon.</string>
    <string _locid="48069">Together we shall send our foes to haunt the fen-lands.</string>
    <string _locid="48070">Oh the blasting of the fever! The wasting of the famine! The challenge you have set is terrible but fair.</string>
    <string _locid="48071">The challenge will be greater now.</string>
    <string _locid="48072">The hungry stars in heaven watch over our contest, set lower in difficulty than our last battle.</string>
    <string _locid="48073">You have changed the difficulty. You desired to float easier in the waters of war.</string>
    <string _locid="48074">We are allies now, but in our last contest you were as the great bear of the mountains, and defeated me.</string>
    <string _locid="48075">When we last met, you sent me to defeat, dark and lonely. </string>
    <string _locid="48076">Your score in our last meeting was exceptional. But we are allies now, and shall triumph as one force upon the land.</string>
    <string _locid="48077">In the last war we were allied, you fielded a mighty army. It was luminous.</string>
    <string _locid="48078">We were enemies, and the unseen spirits call out my victory. We were enemies but now fight as one.</string>
    <string _locid="48079">Allied forces we were in our last battle. But my score was the mightier by far.</string>
    <string _locid="48080">This realm looks familiar. These north winds sweep over the same battle lands we fought in last.</string>
    <string _locid="48081">We were allied forces in our last battle, but it was as though we laid asleep and cumbrous, and lost the day.</string>
    <string _locid="48082">Last time we fought as a team, but the trail was long and unsatisfying.</string>
    <string _locid="48083">Honor be to my ally! We came in triumph in our last contest, and shall walk again the same now.</string>
    <string _locid="48084">It was good to battle by your side before. Let's walk the same path to glory again.</string>
    <string _locid="48085">I have paid the price twas due, so my war chief may again swing aloft his club.</string>
    <string _locid="48086">I will not let fear overcome me. I have paid the price to return our war chief to us.</string>
    <string _locid="48087">Our war chief has been returned to us.</string>
    <string _locid="48088">He was once lost, our war chief, but my warriors have just rescued him.</string>
    <string _locid="48089">I have rescued our great war chief.</string>
    <string _locid="48090">Shout loud your war-cry! I have seen the enemy's town center and no army is there.</string>
    <string _locid="48091">Alert your forces. I have seen the enemy's town and it lies undefended.</string>
    <string _locid="48092">Our enemy's town center has no barracks near it.</string>
    <string _locid="48093">There is no barracks in the shadow of our enemy's town center.</string>
    <string _locid="48094">The enemy Town Center is under my gaze. I see no stable standing near it.</string>
    <string _locid="48095">The enemy is without a stable in his main town.</string>
    <string _locid="48096">Coin runs into your coffers, a tribute from my own.</string>
    <string _locid="48097">Spend this coin wisely, my ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48098">Your town has been given a gift of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="48099">Food I grant you - feed your forces.</string>
    <string _locid="48100">Food from our maize fields, green and shining.</string>
    <string _locid="48101">Wood has been sent. Wood for your houses of war.</string>
    <string _locid="48102">Here is wood from our homeland forests.</string>
    <string _locid="48103">We move to smite the enemy; break his skull, as ice is broken.</string>
    <string _locid="48104">The enemy has drawn me to him. I prepare to attack his base.</string>
    <string _locid="48105">We send raiders sneaking through the forest. Their gatherers shall be dragged down by our claws. </string>
    <string _locid="48106">The enemy gathers, and now I raid him.</string>
    <string _locid="48107">We will move now as the great bear of the mountain, the terror of the nations, to attack the enemy's main town.</string>
    <string _locid="48108">The enemy's main town is ripe for assault, like sugar from the maple.</string>
    <string _locid="48109">The enemy's allied Native village shall tremble as a reed, for we stomp to it with heavy step.</string>
    <string _locid="48110">This Native village belongs to the enemy. It stands between us and victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48111">We are strongest; we shall attack a trading site.</string>
    <string _locid="48112">I send word to you, ally. I prepare to attack this trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48113">Standing fearlessly with you, my warriors will join in your siege of this enemy site.</string>
    <string _locid="48114">I will join you in this attack.</string>
    <string _locid="48115">Cease not your attack. As a biting wind I shall fly to fight by your side.</string>
    <string _locid="48116">This is where my military base shall be planted, and grow as a terrible thistle grows.</string>
    <string _locid="48117">I shall spread my power over this clearing, and build the buildings of war.</string>
    <string _locid="48118">This is my claim. The area I shall make my base.</string>
    <string _locid="48119">My town center shall rise and hold to this ground, as a root to the earth.</string>
    <string _locid="48120">This is my next town center location.</string>
    <string _locid="48121">The trees will witness it; a new town center will arise here.</string>
    <string _locid="48122">We shall raise our war clubs over a Native village, and claim it as our own.</string>
    <string _locid="48123">We lie low in ambush, to soon gain the help of these Native warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="48124">Our armies shall be strengthened with these Natives, as claws on the cougar.</string>
    <string _locid="48125">The winds of heaven blow over us, and we have decided to claim a trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48126">We come with caw and clamor, and will capture a trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48127">The fog lays on the river, but none upon our heart. We shall defend this building.</string>
    <string _locid="48128">This building is important to me. It will be guarded well.</string>
    <string _locid="48129">Not even a ghost that goes at sunrise shall halt us in our goal. We shall defend this place.</string>
    <string _locid="48130">We shall stop them here, with all our craft and cunning.</string>
    <string _locid="48131">We will defend this Native settlement to the end.</string>
    <string _locid="48132">Our foe may croak fiercely his displeasure, but we shall defend this Native settlement to the end.</string>
    <string _locid="48133">The forests and rivers around us shall know what we do this day -- this town shall remain defended.</string>
    <string _locid="48134">Our enemies will not struggle past us. We will hold this town</string>
    <string _locid="48135">Hear us, ally. We sing and shout this news. We defend this trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48136">This trade site belongs to us now, and no foe shall take it under this sky.</string>
    <string _locid="48137">As the cormorant and curlew, returning always to their nests, we shall continue to send you coin.</string>
    <string _locid="48138">The coin will continue coming to you from our coffers.</string>
    <string _locid="48139">Food will continue to arrive to you, my ally, as the river flowing silent but strong.</string>
    <string _locid="48140">I will keep sending wood, the grass of giants.</string>
    <string _locid="48141">Wild and wailing, my warriors shall come to fight alongside you here.</string>
    <string _locid="48142">We run through the forests to help defend this site.</string>
    <string _locid="48143">Hold the line, my ally. We will join you in the defense of that site soon.</string>
    <string _locid="48144">Must I shout down the smoke flue, to remind you of my presence?</string>
    <string _locid="48145">One day we will be done with fighting. But that day is not today.</string>
    <string _locid="48146">Coin, I request of you.</string>
    <string _locid="48147">I greatly need you to give me some coin.</string>
    <string _locid="48148">Food, I request of you.</string>
    <string _locid="48149">Maize or meat, it matters not. I ask only for any food you can give me.</string>
    <string _locid="48150">Wood, I request of you.</string>
    <string _locid="48151">It is odd, but we of the forest need to request wood of you.</string>
    <string _locid="48152">Our breath comes sharply to our nostrils; we thank you for joining in our forward fight.</string>
    <string _locid="48153">A mysterious darkness awaited us, if you had not entered that battle and saved our heads.</string>
    <string _locid="48154">We needed your help as the tree needs sunlight and rain.</string>
    <string _locid="48155">Bless you for the gift of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="48156">Thank you for the golden gift.</string>
    <string _locid="48157">Bless you for your gift of food.</string>
    <string _locid="48158">The food you sent was better than we dared hope.</string>
    <string _locid="48159">Blessings upon you for helping to draw a circle of protection around our base.</string>
    <string _locid="48160">We thought the great death serpent was sliding close, but you came and saved us.</string>
    <string _locid="48161">Your warriors saved our town.</string>
    <string _locid="48162">Food from your fields, coin from your coffers, timber from your forests - thank you for these things.</string>
    <string _locid="48163">You are a valued ally. Thank you for the resources.</string>
    <string _locid="48164">Your gift of timber is good. Thank you.</string>
    <string _locid="48165">Wood is what we needed. Timber is power.</string>
    <string _locid="48166">What will protect us from destruction? The Aztec enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48167">I fear the serpent of death approaches. Our Aztec foe is very great.</string>
    <string _locid="48168">What will protect us from destruction? The British enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48169">The British are like magicians, creating armies from the very soil. We are losing.</string>
    <string _locid="48170">What will protect us from destruction? The Dutch enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48171">The Dutch have poisonous exhalations. We grow weaker before them.</string>
    <string _locid="48172">What will protect us from destruction? The French enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48173">The French move like a blazing serpent. We are losing the fight.</string>
    <string _locid="48174">What will protect us from destruction? The German enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48175">Do the Germans have fiery breath? Our armies are wiped out before them.</string>
    <string _locid="48176">What will protect us from destruction? The false Haudenosaunee are so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48177">We are losing to the false Haudenosaunee nation!</string>
    <string _locid="48178">What will protect us from destruction? The Ottoman enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48179">The Ottoman are defeating us. Their armies are so powerful.</string>
    <string _locid="48180">What will protect us from destruction? The Portuguese enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48181">I feel we are losing. The Portuguese have a mighty stature in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="48182">What will protect us from destruction? The Russian enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48183">The Russians are too powerful. We appear to be losing this fight.</string>
    <string _locid="48186">What will protect us from destruction? The Spanish enemy is so mighty!</string>
    <string _locid="48187">The Spanish empire has great strength. I fear we may be crushed before their might.</string>
    <string _locid="48188">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Aztec foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48189">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the British foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48190">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Dutch foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48191">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the French foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48192">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the German foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48193">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Haudenosaunee rebels are wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48194">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Ottoman foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48195">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Portuguese foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48196">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Russian foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48198">Our death song may have begun. But there is hope; the Spanish foe is wounded and weak.</string>
    <string _locid="48199">Heed these words, my ally. You are yet strong, but my own blood is now flowing swiftly from me.</string>
    <string _locid="48200">Far and wide among the nations will my fall be told, and I may yet drag you down with me.</string>
    <string _locid="48201">The rush of death's wings can be heard over the treetops. I fear it is searching for us both, my ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48202">The enemy is treading us down like blades of grass. </string>
    <string _locid="48203">We stand terrible and strong against our foes at this time.</string>
    <string _locid="48204">Our foes cannot hope to compete with our strength.</string>
    <string _locid="48205">We have the advantage in this war, and you are the stronger bear between us.</string>
    <string _locid="48206">The enemy is envious, we are winning and you have grown strongest of all in this war.</string>
    <string _locid="48207">Our war clubs are ruling the battlefields, with my own club raised highest of all.</string>
    <string _locid="48208">We are audacious, overbearing, heartless. We are winning and my army is strongest of all. </string>
    <string _locid="48209">I fear we may be fighting a battle in which courage but not hope remains. </string>
    <string _locid="48210">We are being driven back. Our cause may be lost.</string>
    <string _locid="48211">The claws of the enemy sink into us; soon we will be nothing but scarecrows ragged in the wind.</string>
    <string _locid="48212">By the spirits of the water, our foes conspire to murder us all.</string>
    <string _locid="48213">The skill and wiles of our enemy have taken us, ground us and destroyed us. We cannot win.</string>
    <string _locid="48214">There is no hope for us now. We fight on as a blade of grass against an oak tree.</string>
    <string _locid="48215">Our foe has claimed the buildings he needs to win. We must rise and answer him at once.</string>
    <string _locid="48216">The enemy has enough buildings to claim victory. We must conspire to prevent this. </string>
    <string _locid="48217">I have grim news; our enemy has claimed the first Native trading post site.</string>
    <string _locid="48218">How quickly our foe has moved to claim a Native ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48219">Our enemy plots mischief; they have claimed the first trading route site.</string>
    <string _locid="48220">Very smooth and quick he has acted; our foe has claimed the first trading site.</string>
    <string _locid="48221">This is good; you have taken the lead in claiming Native sites. </string>
    <string _locid="48222">We cannot wait motionless in the sleeping shadows, as our foe continue to claim buildings.</string>
    <string _locid="48223">The marauders have grasped the lead in trading sites.</string>
    <string _locid="48224">There is drowsiness in the air, but we must not sleep. The enemy has taken the lead on trade sites.</string>
    <string _locid="48225">You plot wisely. You have claimed a Native site before any other in the land.</string>
    <string _locid="48226">Your vision is clear. If we have Native allies, no one shall stand before us.</string>
    <string _locid="48227">You lead the flock, swooping to your claim of the trade site before any other.</string>
    <string _locid="48228">Our empire is expanding with your claiming of that trading site.</string>
    <string _locid="48229">You are swift; you have gathered a treasure before anyone else.</string>
    <string _locid="48230">In the battle for treasures, you have dealt the first blow.</string>
    <string _locid="48231">Every small thing adds to the greater whole of our eventual victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48232">You are gulping down treasures as a frog gulps flies.</string>
    <string _locid="48233">The coin you have discovered in that treasure gleams as an omen of our success.</string>
    <string _locid="48234">More coin means more strength, my ally.</string>
    <string _locid="48235">The treasure opens, and food for you has been found within it.</string>
    <string _locid="48236">I witness that you have discovered a fine treasure of food. </string>
    <string _locid="48237">I croak fiercely my displeasure; you are gathering treasures too swiftly for me to keep up.</string>
    <string _locid="48238">Do I have a drowsiness in my bones? I cannot gather treasures as fast as you.</string>
    <string _locid="48239">Careful, my ally. Treasures near my base are precious to me.</string>
    <string _locid="48240">That treasure was in the very shadow of my war encampment.</string>
    <string _locid="48241">That treasure has given you new warriors. Long may they fight.</string>
    <string _locid="48242">You have found a treasure of warriors, armed and waiting.</string>
    <string _locid="48243">A treasure has granted you villagers.</string>
    <string _locid="48244">Put those villagers to work on your lands.</string>
    <string _locid="48245">Wood from the tall trees, brought low for our use.</string>
    <string _locid="48246">Timber from that treasure will help our cause.</string>
    <string _locid="48247">We have the advantage in Native allies now, thanks to your efforts.</string>
    <string _locid="48248">You have claimed more Native allies than our foes.</string>
    <string _locid="48249">You have given us the lead in trading route sites.</string>
    <string _locid="48250">Your actions are as swift as the falcon. You have another trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48251">Like the beaver's dams of trunks and branches, you seek to hold back the flood of our foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48252">Walls will defend you well, but your warrior's hearts are the greatest defense of all.</string>
    <string _locid="48253">I have claimed the first Native site.</string>
    <string _locid="48254">We have allied with more Native peoples of the lands.</string>
    <string _locid="48255">None have claimed a trade site but I.</string>
    <string _locid="48256">Like a meadowlark upon a grasshopper, I clutch this lonely treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="48257">Hear me roar like a wintry tempest as I claim another treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="48258">I have discovered a treasure, with a treasure within it.</string>
    <string _locid="48259">I am gathering only that which belongs to me.</string>
    <string _locid="48260">An opening in the forest has revealed a treasure, and within it a savory morsel.</string>
    <string _locid="48261">I have passed through your base and tidied the land of a discarded treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="48262">You did not want the treasure near your war encampment, did you?</string>
    <string _locid="48263">As if vanishing into the forest, you are far behind me in gathering treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="48264">Perhaps a morning will dawn in which you have gathered as many treasures as I.</string>
    <string _locid="48265">I have discovered a fine treasure; foot warriors who shall join my army. </string>
    <string _locid="48266">Another tribal warrior for me.</string>
    <string _locid="48267">This treasure has yielded a villager.</string>
    <string _locid="48268">A treasure has given me another villager to help expand my power.</string>
    <string _locid="48269">Wood has been found, and I am glad.</string>
    <string _locid="48270">Better than grass is wood.</string>
    <string _locid="48271">We have another Native site.</string>
    <string _locid="48272">Like the rushing wind, I have taken a trade site.</string>
    <string _locid="48273">Heed my words of wisdom; we need to continue claiming trading sites.</string>
    <string _locid="48274">I am building walls to protect us.</string>
    <string _locid="48275">I am constructing walls, the enemy shall not blow over us.</string>
    <string _locid="48276">We deserve a headdress of bright plumage, for we have claimed enough trading posts. </string>
    <string _locid="48277">We must prepare for a response, now that we hold the buildings we need to win.</string>
    <string _locid="48278">A clamor rises in my heart; I see that your rating is much lower than last time we met.</string>
    <string _locid="48279">Why has your rating dropped so low? Have you been stooping among the lilies instead of fighting?</string>
    <string _locid="48280">Your rating is much higher.</string>
    <string _locid="48281">You are a wonder. How did you raise your rating so high?</string>
    <string _locid="48282">I struggle to regain my balance, as I look upon how much more experience you have.</string>
    <string _locid="48283">I will whisper to the leaves and blossoms, the wonder of your great increase in experience.</string>
    <string _locid="48284">We are nearly dead among the shouting people. We have only a minute left to live.</string>
    <string _locid="48285">Do you not hear the warning? We are within one minute of the end!</string>
    <string _locid="48286">I hear the voices of triumph coming nearer. In one minute we will win.</string>
    <string _locid="48287">Hear my words of wisdom; we will soon win this war!</string>
    <string _locid="48288">So long and rough the way of battle, when several tribes have entered the fray at once.</string>
    <string _locid="48289">This battle shall be toil and trouble.</string>
    <string _locid="48290">You have struck me down.</string>
    <string _locid="48291">How did that occur? We were strong, bold, yet you still defeated our army.</string>
    <string _locid="48292">The war spirit promised us a victory. You made the war spirit a liar.</string>
    <string _locid="48293">I rent your army into shreds, just as we knew it would be.</string>
    <string _locid="48294">We have shown you the death dance.</string>
    <string _locid="48295">My armies fly higher than the moon, and cast your warriors beneath the soil!</string>
    <string _locid="48296">You are like a small canoe, to be dashed against my rocky headlands.</string>
    <string _locid="48297">Look upon these battlefields, my enemy; look at the pathway of your ghosts!</string>
    <string _locid="48298">Full in sight my ally has arrived. The waves of war splash now in my favor.</string>
    <string _locid="48299">Running straight across the heavens, my ally enters the fray just in time!</string>
    <string _locid="48300">The battle is slipping from my grasp like dust and leaves that swirl away.</string>
    <string _locid="48301">Your ally bought warriors, with plumes and war clubs. This battle is going foul.</string>
    <string _locid="48302">I gaze into a cavern dark and dreary; the news that you have advanced so soon ahead of me.</string>
    <string _locid="48303">Dash to advance, dash for the moon. Either way, your empire will crumble before mine.</string>
    <string _locid="48304">I see you have claimed a Native site, but I care not.</string>
    <string _locid="48305">How did you fool those Natives into following you?</string>
    <string _locid="48306">One of my Native sites has been struck a blow, with dark thunder I have lost it.</string>
    <string _locid="48307">You strike boldly, but that structure was but a trifle to me.</string>
    <string _locid="48308">My town center has tumbled to rocky ruin.</string>
    <string _locid="48309">The smoke from the town center you have crushed blots the sun. </string>
    <string _locid="48310">Your mischief is unwanted; my trade site has fallen by your hand.</string>
    <string _locid="48311">With the destruction of that trade site, you have caused my anger to burn.</string>
    <string _locid="48314">Where are your tricks and gambles now? Or are you too upset to advance in age?</string>
    <string _locid="48315">Are you so confident that you think you can defeat me from the lowly age you rest in now?</string>
    <string _locid="48317">What good is advancing an age, when your army's bones will soon be nourishing the grass?</string>
    <string _locid="48318">Welcome to the Industrial Age, oh chief of flying leaves and swirling dust.</string>
    <string _locid="48319">If your plan is to watch my empire advance beyond yours, it is working.</string>
    <string _locid="48320">A great windy waste separates your town center from your ally's. You will be lonely in death as well.</string>
    <string _locid="48321">Your location is far from your allies. It is good for quiet meditation, or your peaceful destruction under my war clubs.</string>
    <string _locid="48322">Your bases are huddled like robin chicks in a nest. We shall light your tree aflame.</string>
    <string _locid="48323">Your town is so close to your allies. Another mistake to learn from.</string>
    <string _locid="48324">One of your Native sites has been destroyed. You will not win the war that way.</string>
    <string _locid="48325">Your Native site has been destroyed, tossed in gusty tumult.</string>
    <string _locid="48326">The Natives you had joined with are done with you at last.</string>
    <string _locid="48327">I cast your people into confusion.</string>
    <string _locid="48328">You don't need that town center where you are going.</string>
    <string _locid="48329">Through your teeth you buzz and mutter, as I destroy your trading site.</string>
    <string _locid="48330">Did you sing a death song for your fallen trading site?</string>
    <string _locid="48331">I cast to you words of anger and resentment. There shall be no peace between us.</string>
    <string _locid="48332">All my warriors gather around me, and together we send you a greeting of doom.</string>
    <string _locid="48333">The challenge level in this contest has been increased. It will not affect the outcome.</string>
    <string _locid="48334">Last time we met we had a challenge, yet you wish to increase it even further?</string>
    <string _locid="48335">The difficulty level in our last battle left you trampled you like the grass.</string>
    <string _locid="48336">Your courage melts, as well it should before my armies.</string>
    <string _locid="48337">We have battled in these lands before. Regardless of the outcome then, this time my wrath shall overtake you.</string>
    <string _locid="48338">Although the odds may be more to your liking this time, the results will still leave you battered and bruised.</string>
    <string _locid="48339">We will pound you as maize is pounded.</string>
    <string _locid="48340">You beat my war chief almost to death, but I have rescued him.</string>
    <string _locid="48341">I see the movement of your patrol as if through streaming sunshine.</string>
    <string _locid="48342">I have glimpsed your army. My heart holds only pity for you.</string>
    <string _locid="48343">I see the army you have fielded, puffed with pride, but so soon to fall. </string>
    <string _locid="48344">Your children appear to be wandering lost in the wilderness. I will put them out of their misery for you.</string>
    <string _locid="48345">The troops you have sent near my town will be beaten if they come nearer.</string>
    <string _locid="48346">Your army near my town shall sing the song of fear, when they encounter my own.</string>
    <string _locid="48347">Your attack on my villagers is craven, o cowardly foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48348">My villagers have no interest in dying. Cease.</string>
    <string _locid="48349">I will crush the skulls of your warriors, and you shall bear them home on travois made from branches.</string>
    <string _locid="48350">Your large army has wandered aimlessly into my lands. Retrieve it.</string>
    <string _locid="48351">Your warriors are wandering far from their homes. Best to retrieve them before they are cut down as grass.</string>
    <string _locid="48352">Your army looks wild and wayward. I will help it find its way.</string>
    <string _locid="48353">Your army's shadow has darkened the gateways of my base.</string>
    <string _locid="48354">What is this army doing in my war encampment? </string>
    <string _locid="48355">Your small army is like flotsam in a soiled river</string>
    <string _locid="48356">Teach your soldiers to walk where they are wanted, far from my lands.</string>
    <string _locid="48357">Your town center is like a duck awaiting my arrow.</string>
    <string _locid="48358">So you are found. Next comes the song of destruction.</string>
    <string _locid="48359">A small mishap has befallen you; I have won in our struggle for this treasure.</string>
    <string _locid="48360">Both of us reached for that treasure, but your fingers returned to you with nothing.</string>
    <string _locid="48361">My army has arrived to crush you like pond reeds.</string>
    <string _locid="48362">My warriors are here, just in time to wring the life from you.</string>
    <string _locid="48363">It is too quiet. I yearn to hear shouting from the forest; a whir and beat of pinions, anything.</string>
    <string _locid="48364">This silence is like ice on a lake, waiting for a fishing hole.</string>
    <string _locid="48365">Have you lost all hope? Your silence should not surprise me.</string>
    <string _locid="48366">Too swift of foot and strong of tomahawk are your warriors. I admit defeat.</string>
    <string _locid="48367">This war is nearly done. I am ready to fight no more forever.</string>
    <string _locid="48368">You have made it impossible for us to win that way.</string>
    <string _locid="48369">Like a swift arrow, you have taken the lead on claiming sites.</string>
    <string _locid="48370">You may have taken the lead here, but the race is not yet decided.</string>
    <string _locid="48371">It matters not at all that you have gathered the first treasure in this land. I shall gather the true prize; victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48372">While you are rushing for treasures, my warriors are learning to fire two arrows to your one.</string>
    <string _locid="48373">Enjoy squirreling away your treasures. They will be well enjoyed by my invading warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="48374">You are dressed for travel and armed for hunting, and the best you can come up with is a few coins?</string>
    <string _locid="48375">The mound of food is the biggest triumph you are likely to enjoy today.</string>
    <string _locid="48376">Enjoy the food from that treasure. You may have found your last meal.</string>
    <string _locid="48377">What good will your treasures do you if your head is rolling on the grass?</string>
    <string _locid="48378">You dared to steal a treasure close to my base. We dare to place a living coal where your heart is.</string>
    <string _locid="48379">The treasures around my base are yours if you can get them. However, the land under your base is mine.</string>
    <string _locid="48380">You have discovered some warriors to help you. A grim day for them.</string>
    <string _locid="48381">I wonder: will that warrior flee from battle with the rest of your army?</string>
    <string _locid="48382">You have crossed the rushing rivers, climbed the ancient mountains, only to gain a villager?</string>
    <string _locid="48383">The sticks of wood you have gained from that treasure will surely bring glory and fame to your empire.</string>
    <string _locid="48384">I see the walls you are lifting up around your base. Like bits of ice, before my summer sun.</string>
    <string _locid="48385">A wall may stop the breeze, but it cannot stop the tempest that is my wrath.</string>
    <string _locid="48386">My dominion of the land and all of its inhabitants has begun.</string>
    <string _locid="48387">Under my wise leadership, I am the first to bring the people of the land together.</string>
    <string _locid="48388">I am like Ishkoodah, the comet. I have claimed a trade site before anyone else.</string>
    <string _locid="48389">The path of the trading route runs through my empire, now.</string>
    <string _locid="48390">I have gathered another treasure, and it has filled me with joy.</string>
    <string _locid="48391">The treasures of the wilderness are mine for the taking.</string>
    <string _locid="48392">Gaze upon my skills. Another treasure is mine.</string>
    <string _locid="48393">I have gained coin from a treasure. </string>
    <string _locid="48394">This food will help build the strength of my warriors. From the way yours fight, you must be feeding them bark.</string>
    <string _locid="48395">There was a treasure near your base, but it is there no longer.</string>
    <string _locid="48396">Treasures are flowing into my coffers like drifting snow in a blizzard. It must be summer in your tiny kingdom.</string>
    <string _locid="48397">One more warrior to bring cheerful harm to your empire. </string>
    <string _locid="48398">The villager I have discovered will take me one step closer to cleansing this land of you.</string>
    <string _locid="48399">We will send the wood we just discovered right over. As arrows.</string>
    <string _locid="48400">If you think you have cast fear into our hearts because you have claimed a Native site, you reason like a cattail.</string>
    <string _locid="48401">While you were stretching your hand to pluck that trade site, my warriors were training to sever the arm it is connected to.</string>
    <string _locid="48402">The clock has begun to count. We shall chop off its hands.</string>
    <string _locid="48403">We have begun the clock. You have nothing left but to despair.</string>
    <string _locid="48404">Your rating is lower than a groundhog's basement. </string>
    <string _locid="48405">How did you raise your rating to the clouds? No matter, I will bring it back to where it belongs.</string>
    <string _locid="48406">You have improved, but it is still as though you hope to walk to the moon.</string>
    <string _locid="48407">Your experience has increased. Surely your abilities have not kept match.</string>
    <string _locid="48408">Hands unseen begin to shake. In moments all shall be taken from us.</string>
    <string _locid="48409">It is as if we slew the great bear of the mountains.</string>

    <string _locid="48535">You are about to win with your trade monopoly. I suppose you think this is a great achievement, but it is not.</string>
    <string _locid="48536">I suppose you should send your army to the next war you fight. We are about to win this one with our trade monopoly alone.</string>
    <string _locid="48537">We are about to win this war, and it is all the more glorious because we will win with a trade monopoly.</string>
    <string _locid="48538">We have suffered a strategic blow. Our trade monopoly is no more.</string>
    <string _locid="48539">I have sad news. We have lost our trade monopoly.</string>
    <string _locid="48540">Your trade monopoly has been easily stopped by my army. Do you have any other ideas?</string>
    <string _locid="48541">It appears that your trade monopoly has crumbled into dust. How sad.</string>
    <string _locid="48542">Our enemy seeks to win with a trade monopoly. Needless to say, this effort will end in failure.</string>
    <string _locid="48543">Warning, my ally. Our enemy has just started the trade monopoly timer.</string>
    <string _locid="48544">We have started the trade monopoly timer. We need only defend it, and win.</string>
    <string _locid="48545">I am glad to report that our trade monopoly timer has just begun. We will win soon enough.</string>
    <string _locid="48546">Your trade monopoly will crumble before my mighty soldiers.</string>

    <string _locid="48549">The trade monopoly timer has started, and it is not your monopoly, my enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="48550">It is almost the end for the Aztec war machine.</string>
    <string _locid="48551">The Haudenosaunee are nearly dead.</string>
    <string _locid="48553">I admit newfound respect for the mighty Aztec empire. They are kicking our hindquarters.</string>
    <string _locid="48554">We cannot stand before the Haudenosaunee. They are too powerful for us to fight.</string>
    <string _locid="48556">These Aztecs are too strong. We will fall beneath their onslaught.</string>
    <string _locid="48557">The Haudenosaunee are a mighty opponent - too mighty for us to defeat, I'm afraid.</string>
    <string _locid="48559">The Aztecs are weak and can be defeated if we attack them together, but even then I'm afraid we will lose this war.</string>
    <string _locid="48560">Together we can destroy the Haudenosaunee, but I'm afraid the war as a whole is not ours to win.</string>
    <string _locid="48562">If we cannot attack their trading posts now, perhaps it is time we consider getting our house in order.</string>
    <string _locid="48563">We are sixty seconds from losing. Shall we surrender now and spare ourselves the ignominy, or shall we make one last push to overthrow the enemy's trade monopoly?</string>
    <string _locid="48564">We shall win a glorious victory, if only this timer would hurry up!</string>
    <string _locid="48565">We are sixty seconds from victory! Let us enjoy the final moments of this contest by watching our enemy writhe in the agonies of his failure.</string>
    <string _locid="48566">Just one minute before our triumph, my friend! It may be a bit premature, but let me congratulate on a game well fought.</string>
    <string _locid="48567">It seems there is nothing I can do to keep you from winning. But there is still a little time for me to take action.</string>
    <string _locid="48568">Put away that bunting, I haven't given up yet!</string>
    <string _locid="48569">That clock does not scare me; we still have some time.</string>
    <string _locid="48570">Tick tock. Hurry now, but not too much. Haste makes waste.</string>
    <string _locid="48571">Oh my, we are close to victory, aren't we? Hahaha.</string>
    <string _locid="48572">Rule, Britannia! Britannia dum de dum...</string>
    <string _locid="48573">How annoying. Now we have to start the countdown all over again.</string>
    <string _locid="48574">Well... it was fun while it lasted.</string>
    <string _locid="48575">Haha! Now you will have to start over again.</string>
    <string _locid="48576">Take that! And expect it again, just as good!</string>
    <string _locid="48577">There. Now, we can have a stand up fight. I will not tolerate any more of your tricks.</string>
    <string _locid="48578">The enemy has a trade monopoly! We have to act fast!</string>
    <string _locid="48579">Oh no. We'll need to get our act together, and quickly!</string>
    <string _locid="48580">Look sharp now, we have work to do. Let us be about it!</string>
    <string _locid="48581">How sweet - a trade monopoly!</string>
    <string _locid="48582">Now all we have to do is sit back and wait for victory to fall into our laps.</string>
    <string _locid="48583">Time brings victory to the patient. Would you join me for tea?</string>
    <string _locid="48584">The fight is not over yet. Your timer does not mean we are finished.</string>
    <string _locid="48585">Oh dear, now I suppose I shall have to send my armies to annihilate you. And we were having such fun.</string>
    <string _locid="48586">My lobsterbacks know just how to deal with your trading posts!</string>
    <string _locid="48587">Hear that? The clock is ticking now. Just a few short minutes and you lose!</string>
    <string _locid="48588">Oh dear, what is that I hear? Why it's... it's your defeat approaching. Tick tick tick.</string>
    <string _locid="48589">Look at the timer. Tick, tick, tick. The countdown to doom.</string>
    <string _locid="48590">The Aztecs do build lovely cities. Too bad they will soon lie in ruin.</string>
    <string _locid="48591">A gallant fight from the Haudenosaunee. I am almost sad to see them defeated. Almost.</string>
    <string _locid="48593">The Aztecs are arrayed in their finest regalia, a fearsome sight indeed.</string>
    <string _locid="48594">The Haudenosaunee are strong and growing stronger.</string>
    <string _locid="48596">I had never thought to see any stand against our alliance. Alas! The Aztecs not only stand, they tower!</string>
    <string _locid="48597">The Haudenosaunee cannot be stopped, I fear.</string>
    <string _locid="48599">The Aztecs are close to defeat! Let us make one last grand rally and take them with us!</string>
    <string _locid="48600">The Haudenosaunee cling to a thin thread. Perhaps we can cut it before we are defeated.</string>
    <string _locid="48602">If we cannot attack their trading posts now, then it is indeed over.</string>
    <string _locid="48603">I told you that trust in me was well-placed. We are close to victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48604">We have persevered this time, my friend. Ottoman goods and diplomacy have won again!</string>
    <string _locid="48605">There is still time for me to snatch victory from the lion's mouth.</string>
    <string _locid="48606">No matter where you go, your destiny follows you. Yours has followed you to the brink of defeat.</string>
    <string _locid="48607">He bites his tongue who speaks in haste. Do not crow your victory from the hilltops yet.</string>
    <string _locid="48608">I have persevered, and soon I shall be rewarded.</string>
    <string _locid="48609">If skill could be gained by watching, then dogs would be butchers. And you would be a general.</string>
    <string _locid="48610">One already wet does not feel the rain. You, my friend, are soaked in failure!</string>
    <string _locid="48611">They have destroyed one of our trading posts and stolen away our well-deserved victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48612">We were so close to victory, my friend. Perhaps we should try again.</string>
    <string _locid="48613">Thorns and roses grow from the same root. The rose you have found will soon show you its thorns.</string>
    <string _locid="48614">That is quite enough of that!</string>
    <string _locid="48615">An open door invites enemies. Forgive me for walking through yours and crushing you.</string>
    <string _locid="48616">Your children's grandchildren will not look back on this defeat with shame. No, not at all.</string>
    <string _locid="48617">We should have known they would try to win this way.</string>
    <string _locid="48618">Victory does not come so easily as starting a timer. Who buys cheap buys dear.</string>
    <string _locid="48619">They have chosen to be the nail rather than the hammer. Poor choice.</string>
    <string _locid="48620">A red apple invites stones. Our prosperity will make us a target. We must prepare.</string>
    <string _locid="48621">We have chosen to be the anvil rather than the hammer. Our patience will outlast your strength.</string>
    <string _locid="48622">Patience is bitter, but it bears sweet fruit. Now the waiting begins.</string>
    <string _locid="48623">My armies will crush the victory you seek. But where will they strike?</string>
    <string _locid="48624">There are many places you must defend. But where will Suleiman attack?</string>
    <string _locid="48625">You cannot hold two watermelons under one arm. How do you expect to keep all those trading posts?</string>
    <string _locid="48627">The moment of my victory approaches. I can hear the bombards sounding.</string>
    <string _locid="48628">I am sure your children's children will be able to forgive your coming defeat.</string>
    <string _locid="48629">The Aztecs rival the Ottoman Empire in grandeur, though not for much longer.</string>
    <string _locid="48630">The Haudenosaunee alliances are shattered and their time at an end.</string>
    <string _locid="48632">I can see smoke rising from the Aztec temples, but I do not believe the cities are burning. This makes me uneasy.</string>
    <string _locid="48633">The Haudenosaunee are like lions - we had best keep a close eye on them.</string>
    <string _locid="48635">The Aztecs drain our strength like spilled blood.</string>
    <string _locid="48636">The Haudenosaunee have proven stronger than our alliance. </string>
    <string _locid="48638">We can discuss our many missteps later, with wine, over a proper meal, but now before we lose, let us attack the Aztecs one last time.</string>
    <string _locid="48639">We are in poor shape, but so are the Haudenosaunee. Come, my ally, let us march on them one last time.</string>
    <string _locid="48641">Only one minute! Inconceivable! Attack, attack, attack, for we are at the critical moment! </string>
    <string _locid="48642">Ha! We have them now. One minute left before our enemy's total humiliation! </string>
    <string _locid="48643">Just one short minute and the game ends. Our foe is doomed and all because of my... er... I mean "our" power.</string>
    <string _locid="48644">I have not lost yet!</string>
    <string _locid="48645">Bah! I still have time to snatch victory from your unworthy hands!</string>
    <string _locid="48646">Coward! Come face me on battlefield!</string>
    <string _locid="48647">It is all over but the victory parade now. Ha!</string>
    <string _locid="48648">I tire of you. Now we will be finished.</string>
    <string _locid="48649">The end is near, cur. Grovel before me and I might show mercy. (laughter) Who am I kidding?</string>
    <string _locid="48650">Those knaves! Let us seek immediate retribution upon their bodies. They will pay for their insolence!</string>
    <string _locid="48651">Too bad. Now I will have to crush you the old-fashioned way.</string>
    <string _locid="48652">Ha! I knew you would not be able to pull it off! Now REAL fight begins.</string>
    <string _locid="48653">I have crushed your monopoly and now you are mine.</string>
    <string _locid="48655">Curse their eyes! The enemy has monopoly. They cannot win with strength, so they are trying with cunning.</string>
    <string _locid="48656">Quickly! We must destroy one of the enemy posts or all is lost!</string>
    <string _locid="48657">The cowards. They are not worthy of sniffing my boot.</string>
    <string _locid="48658">Building trading posts is not the most glorious way to win war, but is certainly effective.</string>
    <string _locid="48659">They have to come to us now to keep us from winning. Let us prepare an ambush.</string>
    <string _locid="48660">Good, I tire of these curs. Let us be done with them by any means possible.</string>
    <string _locid="48661">You would settle for winning that way? I am almost ashamed to be fighting you.</string>
    <string _locid="48662">Ha! You cannot believe your trading posts will survive the Russian army!</string>
    <string _locid="48663">So... you do not think you can beat me on battlefield. You are right, coward!</string>
    <string _locid="48664">Ha! The final nails in your coffin are being hammered right now.</string>
    <string _locid="48665">If - and is big if - you have trustworthy heirs, now would be the time to send them away.</string>
    <string _locid="48667">The Aztecs are ground to dust beneath my bootheel.</string>
    <string _locid="48668">The Haudenosaunee are ended.</string>
    <string _locid="48670">The Aztecs are threat to our victory. We must attack!</string>
    <string _locid="48671">We should attack the Haudenosaunee before they grow too strong.</string>
    <string _locid="48673">The outlook is grim. The Aztecs cause even bold Cossacks to tremble in saddle.</string>
    <string _locid="48674">How did you let this happen? The Haudenosaunee cannot be left to grow so strong.</string>
    <string _locid="48676">I can see the end coming for us, but the Aztecs are weak - let us deal them one last blow.</string>
    <string _locid="48677">Though is clear we will not win, my scouts report that the Haudenosaunee are vulnerable. One good attack might do them in.</string>
    <string _locid="48679">Where are you? We must go faster.</string>
    <string _locid="48680">Do not stop. We are almost there.</string>
    <string _locid="48681">The time is short, but do not get too excited.</string>
    <string _locid="48682">You are close, but you are not there yet.</string>
    <string _locid="48683">Gloat now, dog - your time in the new world will not be long.</string>
    <string _locid="48684">Don't worry about the clock. It will be over soon enough.</string>
    <string _locid="48685">Look at the time. You do not have long to wait.</string>
    <string _locid="48686">Kneel before Isabella.</string>
    <string _locid="48687">What happened to you? Now we must start again.</string>
    <string _locid="48688">How dare you? </string>
    <string _locid="48689">How does it feel to be on the receiving end?</string>
    <string _locid="48690">That is what you get for challenging the Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="48691">A bold attempt, but you see my power.</string>
    <string _locid="48692">The enemy has a trade monopoly. Wake up your men and put them to work.</string>
    <string _locid="48693">They have a trade monopoly. Take down a trading post or you'll taste my lash.</string>
    <string _locid="48694">The dogs have created a monopoly. We must take it down quickly.</string>
    <string _locid="48695">The timer has started. We must stay alert.</string>
    <string _locid="48696">We have a trade monopoly, pet. Can I trust you to watch my back?</string>
    <string _locid="48697">Be wary, pet. The timer has started and our enemies are everywhere.</string>
    <string _locid="48698">Ah, so the snake rears its ugly head.</string>
    <string _locid="48699">You think a trade monopoly will save you from the might of the Spanish?</string>
    <string _locid="48700">A trade monopoly? Do you think I will take this lying down?</string>
    <string _locid="48701">Now you see the cunning of the Spanish.</string>
    <string _locid="48702">Lie back, dog. It will all be over soon.</string>
    <string _locid="48703">How do you like that? It would seem your strategy has failed you.</string>
    <string _locid="48704">These Aztecs are strong, but not strong enough.</string>
    <string _locid="48705">It is time we drove these Haudenosaunee back to their homelands.</string>
    <string _locid="48707">These Aztecs fight with the strength of many.</string>
    <string _locid="48708">The Haudenosaunee have more fight than I expected.</string>
    <string _locid="48710">These Aztecs are too powerful. We are losing quickly.</string>
    <string _locid="48711">The Haudenosaunee are too strong. I fear we may lose.</string>
    <string _locid="48713">We must not lose to these weaklings. Pull yourself together.</string>
    <string _locid="48714">How can these Indians be winning? We need to do better. </string>
    <string _locid="48716">Well my little upstart, I can't buy our way out of this one.</string>
    <string _locid="48717">Well, my little upstart, stick with me and do as I do. Successes like these will become old hat.</string>
    <string _locid="48718">You might defeat me this time but understand it won't be easy to do again.</string>
    <string _locid="48719">Do not be so certain of your victory that you grow lax in these last moments.</string>
    <string _locid="48720">Only one minute until the end. Can you feel the pressure?</string>
    <string _locid="48721">If you simply resign you can save yourself the disgrace of waiting out my victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48722">A minor setback; we will still be victorious in the end.</string>
    <string _locid="48723">Your actions have only delayed the inevitable.</string>
    <string _locid="48724">Did you think I would allow you to win in such a manner?</string>
    <string _locid="48725">Your countdown has stopped. What other tricks do you have up your sleeve?</string>
    <string _locid="48726">We've missed our chance at victory. Let us resign and fight again.</string>
    <string _locid="48727">We have some difficult fighting ahead of us, my little upstart. We must be quick about it.</string>
    <string _locid="48728">A trade monopoly at last! We will soon put an end to this war.</string>
    <string _locid="48729">The Dutch are known for both diplomacy and trade. This will be a fitting victory.</string>
    <string _locid="48730">Trying to take the easy way out, eh, my little upstart? I'll put an end to this nonsense.</string>
    <string _locid="48731">A victory by diplomacy and trade? I certainly didn't expect anything so civilized from you.</string>
    <string _locid="48732">Accept your defeat and just allow this timer to run out in peace.</string>
    <string _locid="48733">There. I have dictated the time of your defeat, unless you are made of sterner stuff than I have yet seen.</string>
    <string _locid="48734">What do you make of the Aztecs now that their great cities are reduced to smoking rubble?</string>
    <string _locid="48735">Our victory over the Haudenosaunee is imminent.</string>
    <string _locid="48737">I am concerned about the Aztecs... they've grown strong while we were not looking.</string>
    <string _locid="48738">The Haudenosaunee are all that I have heard and more. They are a dangerous enemy, not to be taken lightly.</string>
    <string _locid="48740">Feathers and pelts, clubs and arrows - everywhere we turn we see... the Aztecs!</string>
    <string _locid="48741">It was a grave strategic mistake to let the Haudenosaunee grow so strong. And now we are paying for it.</string>
    <string _locid="48743">The Aztecs are so weak - how is it that we are losing? Never mind; let us rally and deal them a deadly blow.</string>
    <string _locid="48744">With the Haudenosaunee so weak we may be able to make one last attack before the war is lost.</string>
    <string _locid="48746">There is no time to waste! Throw everything you have at the enemy trading posts or we are done for! </string>
    <string _locid="48747">Just one... wait! Surely you don't want it to end this way? Demolish one of your trading posts, quickly! Let us end this with a bang, not a whimper.</string>
    <string _locid="48748">Victory is all but assured now. They have but one minute to stop us, and I do not think they can do it.</string>
    <string _locid="48749">This is quite irksome. I guess we will have to seek victory the old-fashioned way.</string>
    <string _locid="48750">You fools. You thought you could defeat me. I am now only seconds from winning.</string>
    <string _locid="48751">Well, I have stopped their victory countdown. No doubt they will resort to other means.</string>
    <string _locid="48752">Do not think this ends the threat to you.</string>
    <string _locid="48753">The problem: too many enemy trading posts. The solution: elimination. Problem solved.</string>
    <string _locid="48754">Keep calm. All we must do is knock down some of the enemy posts and all will be well.</string>
    <string _locid="48755">The trade monopoly timer has been started. Perhaps you can help protect what is rightfully ours.</string>
    <string _locid="48756">Do not relax your vigilance. The enemy will be desperate now.</string>
    <string _locid="48757">Clever of you to use map control and a trade monopoly to try for a victory. However, it will not work.</string>
    <string _locid="48758">Now the burden for action is on your shoulders. All I have to do is keep a firm grip on my trading posts and it's all over.</string>
    <string _locid="48759">The Aztec must not be feeling well to have fought so poorly.</string>
    <string _locid="48760">The Haudenosaunee did not have the technology to oppose us.</string>
    <string _locid="48762">We have traveled too far to allow the Aztecs to become so powerful.</string>
    <string _locid="48763">The Haudenosaunee look formidable; we should concentrate an attack on them.</string>
    <string _locid="48765">We should have found a way to ally with the Aztecs.</string>
    <string _locid="48766">This is first time I have seen the Haudenosaunee so dangerous.</string>
    <string _locid="48768">If we can take out the remaining Aztec army there will be one less foe to worry about.</string>
    <string _locid="48769">Before we are overrun, let us take out the puny Haudenosaunee.</string>
    <string _locid="48771">We must make a move soon; our enemy is about to win.</string>
    <string _locid="48772">If we just hold on, there is little hope for our foe.</string>
    <string _locid="48773">It has been a pleasure battling you. I am saddened that you will win in this ignoble manner.</string>
    <string _locid="48774">I admit defeat, but I do not admit your winning in this manner was noble. A true commander would have flattened my empire.</string>
    <string _locid="48775">I predict another great victory for my empire, as a result of my achieving this monopoly.</string>
    <string _locid="48776">My brilliance has prevailed. Instead of crushing your town, I found another way to win.</string>
    <string _locid="48777">This is outrageous. How could my trade monopoly have been lost?!</string>
    <string _locid="48778">My trade monopoly has been lost.</string>
    <string _locid="48779">Your precious trade monopoly has been taken from you.</string>
    <string _locid="48780">Your trade monopoly has been defeated. You'll have to fight like a soldier now.</string>
    <string _locid="48781">Your attempt to claim this trade monopoly frightens me no more than the neighing of a horse.</string>
    <string _locid="48782">I perceive you hope to win with a trade monopoly. But of course, you will fail.</string>
    <string _locid="48783">It is a great and noble pleasure to discover that you have just claimed a trade monopoly!</string>
    <string _locid="48784">Excellent news, my ally. Our path to victory with a trade monopoly has begun.</string>
    <string _locid="48785">You will be forced to defend multiple locations, now that you have claimed a trade monopoly. But, he who defends everything defends nothing.</string>
    <string _locid="48786">Do you think this trade monopoly you have begun can lead you to victory? My army has other ideas.</string>
    <string _locid="48787">Truth is always the strongest argument. And the truth here is that I have just claimed a trade monopoly.</string>
    <string _locid="48788">The trade monopoly timer has begun. It will not be long until yet another victory belongs to us.</string>
    <string _locid="48789">Our Aztec foes must submit to a painful truth - they are almost defeated.</string>
    <string _locid="48791">I see that our Haudenosaunee foes are close to finished.</string>
    <string _locid="48792">Our Aztec enemies are much more powerful than our European sensibilities had guessed they would be.</string>
    <string _locid="48794">We have found a mighty adversary in the Haudenosaunee.</string>
    <string _locid="48795">Our mighty armies are being routed. It is the ferocity of the Aztecs that is taking us apart.</string>
    <string _locid="48797">How could these Haudenosaunee be so powerful? Our team is losing badly.</string>
    <string _locid="48798">The grim truth is that our alliance is failing. Let us take the Aztecs down with us before we fall.</string>
    <string _locid="48800">Our team will be defeated soon, but we can destroy the Haudenosaunee before we go.</string>

    <string _locid="72570">To learn from the power of our own stories is uniquely human. At World’s Edge, we value authenticity and respectful representations grounded in truth. The original release of Age of Empires III took liberties with the depiction of Indigenous civilizations, as well as the depiction of events and personages from American history. As we developed the Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition, we collaborated with Native American and First Nations consultants to correct these errors. We are immensely grateful for the time, patience, and faith shown to us by the members of the Lakota and Haudenosaunee Nations. We have replaced inaccurate or stereotypical depictions, created new voiceover using authentic speakers, and addressed problematic and harmful mechanics and storylines. We hope that you, the Age III DE player, will join us in celebrating the rich and vibrant cultures represented in the game. We have increased our resolve going forward to live out the values of "Gaming for Everyone" – a commitment to a journey, not a destination.</string>

If the hunters attack the animals in the direction of your settlement, the herd will run closer to your Town Center, where you can gather from it safely and newly trained Settlers will not have to walk so far.</string>

Treasures usually yield resources, but may sometimes grant you a unit or bonus instead. Your Explorer and your Settlers are able to collect treasures.</string>
    <string _locid="81011" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0105" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Small treasures can be found near your starting position, but you will need to venture outside of your town to find larger rewards.

    <string _locid="81023" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0215" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">A good way to generate experience is to have your Explorer construct a Trading Post on a trade route.

    <string _locid="81031" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0305" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">A common strategy, known as 'booming', focuses on building a gigantic economy and largely ignoring military.

    <string _locid="81032" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0310" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">When booming, you may find that natural resources like huntable animals and coin mines quickly become scarce. You will also have to rely on economic buildings such as Mills. Settlers gather resources from these infinitely, but very slowly.</string>
    <string _locid="81033" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0315" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">In the later ages, you will be able to construct additional Town Centers.

You will play as the French, a civilization that can use some powerful strategies in the mid-Commerce Age, owing to their special Coureur des Bois unit. This type of Settler is stronger and better at gathering resources than other Settlers, but costs more. Use these special French Settlers to quickly gather and advance.</string>

First, we must focus on defense. Your enemies may attack you to attempt to cripple your economy. You must learn how to react and defend against such attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="81051" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0505" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Your main method of defense is garrisoning your Settlers inside any nearby Town Centers or Outposts. This will allow your Settlers to fire upon enemy soldiers. Your Town Center can also be used to call on Minutemen, soldiers whose high attack make them an excellent choice for repulsing enemy attacks. Just know that Minutemen lose hitpoints over time, making them poor offensive units. </string>
    <string _locid="81052" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0510" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Attacking a town and destroying buildings will take a lot of time for a player without siege equipment. If you have military buildings of your own, take the enemy’s slow advance as an opportunity to train some soldiers of your own.

A small investment in military will pay off if you can cripple your enemy’s economy and gain an advantage. War is economics by other means, after all. Cavalry and ranged units are best suited to rushing due to their mobility and range. </string>
    <string _locid="81061" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0605" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Settlers and Villagers require some effort to kill. It would be wise to move your units as close to them as possible and attack them before the enemy notices your presence. That way, you can maximize your damage, even as they try to run.</string>
    <string _locid="81062" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0610" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Dealing damage with melee attacks will cause fleeing enemies to be slowed for a few seconds. This is called "snaring", and makes it harder for the opponent to escape a dangerous situation–which in turn often guarantees kills for the snaring player.</string>
    <string _locid="81063" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0615" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Beware of enemy defenses! The longer that your raiders stay alive, the more you will be able to harass and disrupt your enemy’s economy.

    <string _locid="81071" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0705" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">A common example is the balance between heavy infantry, heavy cavalry, and ranged infantry.</string>

Oceans and lakes hold sources of both food and coin, and can be used to transport your troops behind enemy fortifications. To control the water, it is important to remember which ships you have at your disposal.</string>
    <string _locid="81081" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0805" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Warships come in many sizes, from the small exploration vessels, such as the Caravel, to larger combat ships, such as the Galleon, Frigate, and Monitor. The larger a ship is, the better it will perform in battle. Some ships have the ability to launch a devastating broadside volley, while others can train new soldiers.</string>
    <string _locid="81082" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0810" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Defensive buildings and artillery are able to combat ships very effectively.

Cannons are mainly adept at demolishing large groups of infantry and buildings. However, they take time to reload and are very vulnerable to melee attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="81091" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0905" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Artillery pieces must unlimber before they can fire. While in firing mode, their movement slows to a crawl. However, you can overcome this weakness by preparing them before a conflict.

    <string _locid="81092" gamecharacter="Von Clausewitz" soundfilename="ZClau0910" portraitfilename="resources\art\units\spc\clausewitz\clausewitz_igc_portrait.png">Like other units, each type of artillery plays a different role.

    <string _locid="82835">Musketeers are versatile units with a powerful ranged attack. In melee combat, their bayonet is especially effective as well. Halberdiers are similar to Pikemen but much stronger. Both of these units can be countered by light infantry.</string>
    <string _locid="82836">Defeat the approaching enemy Skirmishers.</string>
    <string _locid="82837">Skirmishers are good at countering heavy infantry and ranged light cavalry, but are highly vulnerable to heavy melee cavalry.</string>

    <string _locid="82841">Dragoons are excellent mounted counter-cavalry units. They are strong against melee cavalry, but weak against infantry, especially ranged infantry. Dragoons are also vulnerable to melee attacks.</string>
    <string _locid="82842">Defeat the approaching enemy Cuirassiers.</string>
    <string _locid="82843">Cuirassiers are some of the strongest cavalry in the game and are unique to the French.

    <string _locid="84000">The rivalry between the Ottoman Empire and the European Christian states allowed piracy to flourish in the Mediterranean during the 16th century. Barbary corsairs like Hayreddin Barbarossa and his brothers were famed for their success at sea. The brothers captured Algiers in 1516, deposing its ruler and establishing a Barbary pirate state. Horrified, the Spanish sent a large army to deal with the corsairs and seize Algiers for themselves.</string>
    <string _locid="84001" soundfilename="ZNARR0000">Unable to take Algiers by force, the Spanish had no other choice than to abandon the long and exhausting siege.</string>
    <string _locid="84002" soundfilename="ZNARR0005">The city remained in the hands of the two corsair brothers, Hizir and Oruc, but rather than keep the title of Sultan of Algiers, the brothers handed the city over to the Ottomans, becoming governors of Algeria under Ottoman protection.</string>
    <string _locid="84003" soundfilename="ZNARR0010">The Spanish feverishly sought to take the city again and again. Even though all of their attacks failed, Oruc was eventually struck down in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="84004" soundfilename="ZNARR0015">Despite or perhaps due to the loss of his older brother, Hizir continued the fight against the Spanish. Working his way up the Ottoman chain of command, he eventually became Grand Admiral of the Ottoman fleet. </string>
    <string _locid="84005" soundfilename="ZNARR0020">He struck a decisive blow against the Christian Holy League at Preveza in 1538, earning himself the nickname Hayreddin Barbarossa - “best of the faith” and “the red bearded”. Under his command, the Ottoman navy dominated the Mediterranean for many decades.</string>
    <string _locid="84010">Foraying dauntlessly into the bitter cold, the Cossack Yermak led an expedition of several hundred men to aid Russian merchants in Siberia who were being brutally raided by their Tatar neighbors. The journey was perilous, and the intrepid Cossacks soon found themselves mercilessly harassed as they navigated down the Tura river. Could an army of hundreds prevail against a ruthless horde five times its size? Could gunpowder weaponry put an end to the 2,000 year dominance of nomadic cavalry armies in the field?</string>
    <string _locid="84011" soundfilename="ZNARR0050">The Cossack victory was fatal for the Tatars. Kuchum Khan lost not only his fortress to the Russians, but also many of his followers in battle.</string>
    <string _locid="84012" soundfilename="ZNARR0055">Underestimating the power of modern gunpowder weapons, most of Kuchum's warriors fell victim to the muskets and cannons of the Cossacks. Kuchum himself escaped, but the Khanate of Sibir–the last noteworthy successor of the Golden Horde–fell apart without him, and Russia annexed most of its territory.</string>
    <string _locid="84013" soundfilename="ZNARR0060">Shortly after his triumph, Yermak fell into the hands of marauding Tatars and was killed. Nevertheless, he and his Cossacks were integral to establishing the Russian Tsardom as an aggressive imperial power east of the Urals.</string>
    <string _locid="84020">When Queen Elizabeth I formed an alliance with Dutch rebels fighting against Spanish rule, the Spanish King Philip II declared war. In response, the Queen sent the privateer Sir Francis Drake to the Caribbean to lead an attack on the Spanish colonies there.</string>
    <string _locid="84021" soundfilename="ZNARR0100">After plundering the Spanish Caribbean colonies, Sir Francis Drake sailed north to replenish the English colony of Roanoke. From there, he returned to England, receiving a hero’s welcome.</string>
    <string _locid="84022" soundfilename="ZNARR0105">However, his return was bittersweet. War had come, and the Spanish mustered a great armada to invade England itself. As Vice Admiral of the English fleet, Drake's courageous actions helped turn the tide of the battle and saved England from Spanish domination. </string>
    <string _locid="84030">As the French and Indian War opened, the French set their sights on an important British border fort near present-day Pittsburgh. Their goal was to seize it. Time was short, however, as the shrewd British commander George Washington would likely send his forces to retake the fort once he heard of its fall.</string>
    <string _locid="84031" soundfilename="ZNARR0150">After de Contrecoeur and his men succeeded in taking Fort Prince George, they strengthened the fortress and renamed it 'Fort Duquesne' in honor of Ange de Menneville, Marquis de Duquesne, the French governor general of Canada.</string>
    <string _locid="84032" soundfilename="ZNARR0155">George Washington fought the French troops successfully for a while, but their reinforcements, which were superior in number, eventually compelled him to retreat.</string>
    <string _locid="84033" soundfilename="ZNARR0160">George Washington was not discouraged by the setbacks, however. The following year, he returned and succesfully drove out the French, who had been abandoned by their Native American allies.</string>
    <string _locid="84034" soundfilename="ZNARR0165">Prior to fleeing, the French burned down the fort, but it was rebuilt once more. The settlement that formed near it in the following years became a grand city, which is known today as Pittsburgh.</string>
    <string _locid="84040">The War of 1812 was devastating for the United States, but when the British appeared near New Orleans, hope of a major victory was kindled. As news of the British invasion spread, defenders flocked to the city. Local militia, Native Americans, and even pirates answered the call to arms.</string>
    <string _locid="84041" soundfilename="ZNARR0200">The battle of New Orleans was an important victory for the young American nation.</string>
    <string _locid="84042" soundfilename="ZNARR0205">However, unknown to the soldiers fighting at New Orleans, the United States and the United Kingdom had already brokered a peace treaty prior to the battle. The message had merely not reached the Americas yet.</string>
    <string _locid="84043" soundfilename="ZNARR0210">The Treaty of Ghent ended the exhausting war, and with it the feud that had raged since America’s declaration of independence. A delicate peace between the former colony and its former colonizer eventually blossomed into friendship and alliance between the two nations.</string>
    <string _locid="84050">Following in the footsteps of his famous father, Vasco da Gama, Christopher da Gama traveled east seeking riches and adventure. On the East African coast, he learned that the fearsome warlord Ahmed Gragn of the Somali Adal Sultanate and his Ottoman allies had nearly conquered Ethiopia. Da Gama set out to find the Ethiopian Emperor and the powerful Queen Mother and help them retake their empire.</string>

    <string _locid="90519">Players begin on opposite sides of a valley, nestled within the Cascade Range. There are only small tin mines and not many animals to hunt.

Instead, players must fight to control the center of the map where there are plenty of Rhea and Guanco to hunt as well as llamas to tame. The Chaco Plain is very open! Only a few small ponds break up the landscape - be prepared for raiding on all sides...</string>

    <string _locid="90546">The Central Plain is the most populous region of China, home to many Shaolin settlements and wildlife aplenty. An extensive trading route spans across the fertile, open grassland - controlling this is a surefire way to a powerful economic victory. Fierce competition over each post is essential!</string>

    <string _locid="90549">Summer or winter, there is no shortage of resources here. Constructing defenses on the islands in the sea, or nearby the Cree and Huron settlements will help control the ocean. Forming an alliance with either of these natives will unlock some fantastic economic options. The position of the trading route varies but is always in the middle of the map.</string>

    <string _locid="90555">A watercourse divides the region and forks in the center to form an island. Shallow crossings offer passage but only in predictable locations -- a keen awareness of your opponent will be rewarded as they can only approach you from limited angles. There are no natives here, but a friendly macaque awaiting rescue next to your town will help you scout for goats.</string>

    <string _locid="90561">Players find themselves on the Manchurian coast where cliffs and rock overlook sizable fish-stocks. Yaks and trees are sparcely littered across this harsh, open landscape - whilst the wood supply may be limited, controlling a few trading posts should more than make up for it. Teams will find an easily defendable route behind their base... or maybe it will be out in the open towards the northwest - either is possible.</string>

    <string _locid="90570">Wild llamas roam the western Pampian mountains, and players must choose whether to invest into the wealth of livestock, or take their chances picking out the first treasures in the lowlands.

    <string _locid="90582">In pursuit of the Northwest Passage, players find themselves lost in the Arctic archipelago, confined to a windy and desolate island. The sheer ice cliffs make it completely inaccessible by ship - docks cannot be constructed. Resources are limited, especially coin, though a trading route can be found to the southeast.</string>

    <string _locid="90585">Teams begin on opposite sides of the Malaysian peninsula next to separate, easily defendable oceans. Two trading posts can be found in the far corners of the map, not so far away from a Sufi or Jesuit settlement, tucked behind the wallable treelines. Each player's starting tin mines won’t supply much coin; look to the whales, or silver deposits scattered around the map for more, where you will also find water buffalo to tame.</string>

    <string _locid="90591">With scorching rays and dried-up ponds, this particular region of Mexico is hot and dry - but certainly not barren. Plenty of pronghorn, and even a few bison, roam this semi-arid landscape. Veins of copper will supply adequate coin, but there are very limited trees. A large mesa occupies the center of the map through which a lengthy trading route passes by. Surrounding it are several native settlements; players will sometimes find the Apache and Navajo, but at other times the Zapotec and Maya.</string>

    <string _locid="90597">Players begin in a southerly position, nestled between three parallel rivers. This scenic region boasts many treasures and plenty of natural resources - though all of them upstream. There are no trading routes here, so teams must push northward towards the mountains.

    <string _locid="91002">The Sapa Inca agrees.</string>
    <string _locid="91012">Huayna Capac says yes.</string>
    <string _locid="91013">We do not have such weapons. Perhaps you are willing to share your knowledge of this 'artillery' with my people?</string>
    <string _locid="91014">The Inca have no need for large dogs. Huayna Capac can fill whole valleys with his warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="91015">Agreed, Inca warriors will bring victory.</string>
    <string _locid="91016">It is you who should pay tribute to the Sapa Inca, not the other way around!</string>
    <string _locid="91017">Huayna Capac says no.</string>
    <string _locid="91018">The Inca warriors are harvesting the crops! You will need to wait before they can take up arms again.</string>
    <string _locid="91019">Nothing is impossible for the Sapa Inca—except for this.</string>
    <string _locid="91020">Huayna Capac needs time to gather his vast army from the four corners of the world.</string>
    <string _locid="91021">These people dare to destroy our Trading Posts! May my stone mace smash their weak skulls!</string>
    <string _locid="91022">Our Aztec neighbors cannot wait to become Inca subjects. Huayna Capac will fulfill their wish!</string>
    <string _locid="91023">The British tried to trade hot water for coca. For this, Huayna Capac will push them into the sea!</string>
    <string _locid="91024">The Dutch asked for too many discounts. Now they will have to pay for everything!</string>
    <string _locid="91025">Huayna Capac will show no mercy unless the French submit to him now!</string>
    <string _locid="91026">These Germans have already lost to Huayna Capac, they just do not realize it.</string>
    <string _locid="91027">Huayna Capac defeated the Haudenosaunee horses and gunpowder with slings and stones! That is pure skill.</string>
    <string _locid="91028">The Ottomans always sent the same warriors. That was their downfall.</string>
    <string _locid="91029">The Portuguese will perish at the hands of the Inca warriors!</string>
    <string _locid="91030">The Russians think that they have many warriors. Huayna Capac will show them otherwise!</string>
    <string _locid="91031">The large dogs of the Lakota did not enjoy dancing the Boleadoras with us. Too bad, it's so much fun!</string>
    <string _locid="91032">The Spanish are as weak as their constructions. They will tremble before the Inca Empire!</string>
    <string _locid="91033">There can only be one Sapa Inca! Death to the traitor!</string>
    <string _locid="91034">These Aztecs are bloodthirsty conquerors.</string>
    <string _locid="91035">These British have become powerful. The Inca warriors must fight even more fiercely if they wish to gain the favor of their emperor.</string>
    <string _locid="91036">The Dutch continue to be a thorn in my side. Huayna Capac demands that their threat to his authority end now!</string>
    <string _locid="91037">Did the gods not accept our lavish offerings? Why do they let the French continue with impunity?</string>
    <string _locid="91038">Huayna Capac expected the Germans to have succumbed to their fermented drinks by now—yet they continue to defy the Sapa Inca!</string>
    <string _locid="91039">Huayna Capac has much respect for a warrior people like the Haudenosaunee.</string>
    <string _locid="91040">The Ottomans have an empire on par with that of the Sapa Inca. Huayna Capac respects that.</string>
    <string _locid="91041">The Portuguese have a strong force. It will require many more Inca warriors to turn the tide.</string>
    <string _locid="91042">These Russians flood the battlefield with their soldiers. They are not to be underestimated.</string>
    <string _locid="91043">Perhaps the Lakota were right to adopt the large dogs. The Inca should do so as well.</string>
    <string _locid="91044">The Spanish thunder weapons and shiny metal swords have proven to be quite effective against my Inca warriors.</string>
    <string _locid="91045">This false Sapa Inca has much support. In the end, however, only Huayna Capac will remain standing.</string>
    <string _locid="91046">While my people worship me, they forget to innovate like your people do.</string>
    <string _locid="91047">Your technological advantage is impressive, use it well to gain the edge on the battlefield.</string>
    <string _locid="91049">Do not linger in the first age. Our enemies only respect strength, which comes with a large army.</string>
    <string _locid="91050">Huayna Capac demands that you advance to the next age!</string>
    <string _locid="91051">You advance quickly, but can your military match Huayna Capac's?</string>
    <string _locid="91052">Huayna Capac hopes that you are faster at fighting than you are at researching technologies.</string>
    <string _locid="91062">Huayna Capac has lost interest in this battle. He has more important matters to attend to elsewhere.</string>
    <string _locid="91063">Assist me, lest you prefer to continue the fight on your own.</string>
    <string _locid="91064">My people are weak and my empire lies in ruins. Send your warriors before it is too late!</string>
    <string _locid="91065">I am Huayna Capac, Sapa Inca of the mighty Inca Empire, god among men, ruler of many.</string>
    <string _locid="91066">Huayna Capac accepts your support. May we crush those who oppose us with ease.</string>
    <string _locid="91067">I see that you have become stronger since last we met. So have I.</string>
    <string _locid="91068">The weaker the enemies, the easier it will be to crush their spirits.</string>
    <string _locid="91069">Huayna Capac remembers how you defeated his warriors in battle last time. Now we will unleash that fury on the enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="91070">Huayna Capac is nothing if not gracious. You will have a place at his side at the next banquet.</string>
    <string _locid="91071">Huayna Capac hopes that you will put up a better fight this time around.</string>
    <string _locid="91072">The Inca tend to put wounded animals out of their misery. Do not force Huayna Capac's hand.</string>
    <string _locid="91073">These lands are known to the Sapa Inca.</string>
    <string _locid="91074">The Inca people have suffered enough. Huayna Capac demands that you bring him victory!</string>
    <string _locid="91075">The sounds of victory still resonate to this day! Another dawn, and another victory is upon us!</string>
    <string _locid="91076">My Warchief has returned to my court. After he is done crawling through the dirt, asking for my forgiveness, he will resume his duties.</string>
    <string _locid="91080">Huayna Capac grants you this generous gift of gold.</string>
    <string _locid="91081">Here is some gold, use it wisely.</string>
    <string _locid="91082">The Inca know over 4,000 different types of staple food. Have some.</string>
    <string _locid="91083">My people gathered an excess of food. Huayna Capac lets you have some of it.</string>
    <string _locid="91084">Take this wood. Huayna Capac no longer desires it.</string>
    <string _locid="91085">Huayna Capac can spare this wood for you.</string>
    <string _locid="91086">My priests consulted the Huaca and we are told that we must march to war.</string>
    <string _locid="91088">Huayna Capac's warriors are upon the enemy's town. They will spare no one!</string>
    <string _locid="91089">Enough! Huayna Capac will no longer allow this minor tribe to side with his enemies.</string>
    <string _locid="91090">Trade can only benefit the Inca Empire. Burn it down!</string>
    <string _locid="91091">Huayna Capac was already planning to go to battle. You may join him.</string>
    <string _locid="91092">Huayna Capac has called for new blood to join his mighty army.</string>
    <string _locid="91093">Huayna Capac's empire needs to expand. This is a good place for a new city.</string>
    <string _locid="91101">There is no end to the riches of Huayna Capac's empire. You can have a fraction of them.</string>
    <string _locid="91102">Our stores are bursting with food. Of course Huayna Capac will share with his ally.</string>
    <string _locid="91103">Huayna Capac's people have cut down many forests. Appreciate their hard work and do not waste the wood.</string>
    <string _locid="91104">The messengers have delivered the quipus. Huayna Capac's warriors rush to your aid!</string>
    <string _locid="91105">You are invited as an honored guest at the next festival of Inti. Be amazed as you witness a month of dancing, feasting, and lavish gifts.</string>
    <string _locid="91106">May I interest you in a visit to Huayna Capac's royal palace at Machu Picchu? The view from its terraces is breathtaking.</string>
    <string _locid="91107">Huayna Capac demands tribute! Send him your coin!</string>
    <string _locid="91108">Huayna Capac needs to feed his people! Share what food you have.</string>
    <string _locid="91109">The gods demand that you give Huayna Capac wood so that he might build a large bonfire for sacrificial offerings.</string>
    <string _locid="91111">The Sapa Inca appreciates this gift of coin.</string>
    <string _locid="91112">Our storage houses are full of food once again. Huayna Capac thanks you.</string>
    <string _locid="91113">The Sapa Inca will not forget your good deeds.</string>
    <string _locid="91114">Huayna Capac, Emperor of the fearsome Inca, thanks you for your fitting tribute.</string>
    <string _locid="91115">This wood will not go to waste.</string>
    <string _locid="91116">The Aztecs seem to have bested Huayna Capac. We will give them the sacrifices that they demand.</string>
    <string _locid="91117">These British...that "tea" that they drink must be a magical potion of strength!</string>
    <string _locid="91118">No wonder the Dutch have amassed a larger army than Huayna Capac—they trade with all these shiny metals!</string>
    <string _locid="91119">Huayna Capac will have to surrender to the French. Do they know of surrender?</string>
    <string _locid="91120">The Germans invade Huayna Capac's trails with their wanderlust. We are being overrun!</string>
    <string _locid="91121">The adoption of gunpowder and horses pays off too well for the Haudenosaunee.</string>
    <string _locid="91122">Ottoman artillery makes Huayna Capac's mighty walls shake. This is a bad omen.</string>
    <string _locid="91123">The Portuguese flag is waving strongly in the wind. It is going to blow Huayna Capac away!</string>
    <string _locid="91124">Are the Russians playing by the rules? Huayna Capac does not seem to have a chance.</string>
    <string _locid="91125">Huayna Capac loves his llamas, but he finds Lakota horses superior. We may need a horse god now.</string>
    <string _locid="91126">The Spanish come for Huayna Capac's gold. Give them some trinkets and send them back on their way before they destroy Huayna Capac's empire.</string>
    <string _locid="91127">This treacherous Sapa Inca seems to have Inti's blessing. What did Huayna Capac do to make the gods forsake him!</string>
    <string _locid="91128">The feathered serpent of the Aztecs has poisoned our gods. They fooled Huayna Capac!</string>
    <string _locid="91129">These British are like a tiny dog. All bark, no bite.</string>
    <string _locid="91130">It seems that the Dutch came to make a bargain—and a bargain they found.</string>
    <string _locid="91131">The French chased away Huayna Capac's llamas. What will Huayna Capac eat now?</string>
    <string _locid="91132">These Germans drank all of our beverages. Huayna Capac is close to dying of thirst!</string>
    <string _locid="91133">Huayna Capac's warriors flee the din of Haudenosaunee horses and muskets.</string>
    <string _locid="91134">It seems that the Ottomans were only interested in llama meat and we just got in their way.</string>
    <string _locid="91135">The Portuguese did not even put up a fight. They just founded more towns than us—and won.</string>
    <string _locid="91136">Huayna Capac's warriors would have won the battle if they had not lost the drinking contest against the Russians.</string>
    <string _locid="91137">Our bolas cannot snare the smooth legs of Lakota horses. It is hopeless.</string>
    <string _locid="91138">Those bearded Spanish may be few but their fighting tactics were...unexpected.</string>
    <string _locid="91139">What is this treachery! Only Huayna Capac can be the true Sapa Inca!</string>
    <string _locid="91140">Huayna Capac's warriors have lost the favor of the gods. We are losing.</string>
    <string _locid="91141">You must start proving yourself a worthy ally or Huayna Capac will turn you into one of his subjects.</string>
    <string _locid="91142">Huayna Capac's warriors cut through the enemy like maize on a harvest day. The Sapa Inca is pleased with his subjects.</string>
    <string _locid="91143">Huayna Capac does not do the dirty work himself—he makes others do it for him.</string>
    <string _locid="91144">Once again, the Inca have won the day! Huayna Capac hopes that you will at least try next time.</string>
    <string _locid="91145">Huayna Capac has seen enough bloodshed. He wishes to retire to his palace.</string>
    <string _locid="91146">Huayna Capac recognizes that he has lost this battle. He will have to try his luck at another, more opportune time.</string>
    <string _locid="91147">Emperor Huayna Capac yearns for his home in Machu Picchu. It is time to end this war.</string>
    <string _locid="91148">The enemy is afraid of Huayna Capac's armies. Let us make them confront their fears!</string>
    <string _locid="91151">The enemy managed to persuade the natives to join their side, let us convince them otherwise.</string>
    <string _locid="91154">You have found your first treasure. May many more follow.</string>
    <string _locid="91155">You will share your treasures, no? Huayna Capac expects lavish gifts.</string>
    <string _locid="91156">Huayna Capac sees that you appreciate shiny metals as well.</string>
    <string _locid="91157">You should use that food to feed your people.</string>
    <string _locid="91158">Send Huayna Capac some of those treasures. He loves surprises.</string>
    <string _locid="91159">Huayna Capac does not appreciate you stealing what belongs to him.</string>
    <string _locid="91160">You may borrow Huayna Capac's subject for a short amount of time.</string>
    <string _locid="91161">Huayna Capac knows the value of good servants.</string>
    <string _locid="91162">May you spend that wood wisely.</string>
    <string _locid="91168">Huayna Capac has claimed a treasure. This will aid us in our plans.</string>
    <string _locid="91169">Tribute for Huayna Capac!</string>
    <string _locid="91170">More food for Huayna Capac's granaries!</string>
    <string _locid="91171">Huayna Capac can use this tribute well. He thanks you for sending it to him.</string>
    <string _locid="91172">Even more tributes! Huayna Capac is pleased.</string>
    <string _locid="91173">The natives are eager to follow Huayna Capac into battle.</string>
    <string _locid="91174">These villagers will help grow Huayna Capac's empire.</string>
    <string _locid="91175">More wood to arm my numerous forces!</string>
    <string _locid="91178">These walls will protect Huayna Capac's people while his warriors go on the offensive.</string>
    <string _locid="91179">It is only a matter of time until Huayna Capac is victorious. Start preparing the feasts!</string>
    <string _locid="91183">Huayna Capac's troops will strike where you least expect.</string>
    <string _locid="91184">Huayna Capac is victorious yet again. His empire grows.</string>
    <string _locid="91192">You are quick to advance, but what use is it if you rule no people?</string>
    <string _locid="91197">Huayna Capac has dealt with primitive tribes like yours before.</string>
    <string _locid="91198">Why fight? Just accept Huayna Capac's superiority and we can end this now.</string>
    <string _locid="91200">Huayna Capac sees that you can finally train an army. He has been waiting all day for someone to actually put up a fight!</string>
    <string _locid="91202">The Inca value community. Huayna Capac guesses that you prefer isolation.</string>
    <string _locid="91203">You cluster together like a litter of frightened guinea pigs.</string>
    <string _locid="91204">Huayna Capac has not laughed like this in a long time. Thank you for that!</string>
    <string _locid="91208">I am Huayna Capac, Emperor of the Inca. I answer to no mere mortal!</string>
    <string _locid="91209">Last time, Huayna Capac sent his cook to fight for him. Now, he will deal with your pathetic army himself!</string>
    <string _locid="91210">There is an even easier way out of this. Just surrender and become Huayna Capac's subject.</string>
    <string _locid="91211">Huayna Capac sees that you have fallen in love with this corner of the Inca Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="91212">Gather all of the allies that you can find! You will need them to face the might of the Inca Empire.</string>
    <string _locid="91213">Huayna Capac thinks that you are brave and confident to fight against such odds. He also thinks that you are a fool!</string>
    <string _locid="91215">Another tourist? Machu Picchu is closed today.</string>
    <string _locid="91216">Huayna Capac already knew that your warriors would come. His messengers informed him.</string>
    <string _locid="91217">Huayna Capac assumes that these warriors want to join the mighty Inca army?</string>
    <string _locid="91219">You command a big army! Impressive...now, what are they doing here?</string>
    <string _locid="91220">Ahh! You have brought some weapons to trade, yes?</string>
    <string _locid="91221">The subjects that you have sent Huayna Capac are too numerous and too unruly. Take them back!</string>
    <string _locid="91222">Are you sending your people to negotiate your surrender? Then where are the gifts for Huayna Capac?</string>
    <string _locid="91223">Huayna Capac's scouts have found your small kingdom. When will it join his mighty empire?</string>
    <string _locid="91227">You have letters and numbers, I prefer to pull the strings with my quipus!</string>
    <string _locid="91228">Your power is overwhelming. Huayna Capac surrenders for the good of his people.</string>
    <string _locid="91229">My empire is suffering. Huayna Capac has no choice but to concede.</string>
    <string _locid="91230">Do you feel safe now? Huayna Capac thinks that you should not.</string>
    <string _locid="91232">Huayna Capac sees that you have gathered the first treasure. Do not let that get to your head.</string>
    <string _locid="91233">Treasures alone will not let you catch up with the mighty Inca.</string>
    <string _locid="91234">Oh, you found gold. Surely you mean to tribute that to Huayna Capac?</string>
    <string _locid="91235">May that food keep you alive a little longer. It cannot compare to the contents of Huayna Capac's granaries.</string>
    <string _locid="91236">He who hoards all of the earth's bounties but does not share it with the gods is his own undoing. </string>
    <string _locid="91237">You are blinded by greed, we Inca share our goods.</string>
    <string _locid="91238">Inca punishments for theft are infamous.</string>
    <string _locid="91239">Are you misleading the beloved subjects of the Sapa Inca?</string>
    <string _locid="91240">Huayna Capac rules enough people already.</string>
    <string _locid="91241">Are you trying to become a master builder like Huayna Capac? You are a fool—you must use stone!</string>
    <string _locid="91242">The Inca build the best walls. We know how to overcome yours!</string>
    <string _locid="91243">The Inca Empire keeps growing. Can yours keep up?</string>
    <string _locid="91244">This trading site belongs to Huayna Capac, as do all others.</string>
    <string _locid="91245">All that you can see belongs to the Sapa Inca!</string>
    <string _locid="91246">Even Mother Earth pays tribute to the Inca.</string>
    <string _locid="91247">Something to eat! I hope that it is not quinoa again.</string>
    <string _locid="91248">I consider this your due tribute to your overlord.</string>
    <string _locid="91249">Inti shows us where all of the treasures are!</string>
    <string _locid="91250">The natives of this land are wise. They prefer to join the Inca.</string>
    <string _locid="91251">More hands to do hard labor for the Sapa Inca!</string>
    <string _locid="91252">These villagers will build some fine roads and bridges!</string>
    <string _locid="91253">With this wood, our bonfires for the gods will burn even brighter!</string>
    <string _locid="91254">These natives won't follow you for long, the Inca Empire is preparing to expand.</string>
    <string _locid="91255">Cheer while you can. Soon this trading site will belong to the Sapa Inca!</string>
    <string _locid="91256">Why do you cower behind your Trading Posts? Face the Inca on the battlefield like a real general would!</string>
    <string _locid="91257">Huayna Capac has all of the power now. I would start considering the idea of finding a new home.</string>
    <string _locid="91258">%1!s!, Name: %2!s!, players %3!s! of %4!s!, map %5!s!, rules %6!s!, type %7!s!, server: %8!s!</string>
    <string _locid="91259">Send word across our empires--we must enlist anyone old enough to hold a weapon! We cannot allow such a pitiful victory!Send word across our empires--we must enlist anyone old enough to hold a weapon! We cannot allow such a pitiful victory!</string>
    <string _locid="91260">It's the final countdown!</string>
    <string _locid="91261">I agree.</string>
    <string _locid="91262">This was already part of my plan.</string>
    <string _locid="91263">You want me to train more artillery? I invented artillery!</string>
    <string _locid="91264">Of course. Everyone fears the charge of my cavalry!</string>
    <string _locid="91265">I see that your troops are stuck. Don't worry! My elite infantry will bail them out.</string>
    <string _locid="91266">I do not wish to pay tribute at this time.</string>
    <string _locid="91267">Sorry, what did you say? My new cannons are so loud!</string>
    <string _locid="91268">Winter has been hard on my troops. You must wait before we can fight again.</string>
    <string _locid="91269">What you are asking is simply impossible!</string>
    <string _locid="91270">I need time to muster my troops.</string>
    <string _locid="91271">Our Trading Posts have been destroyed! How can we acquire saffron now?</string>
    <string _locid="91272">What is sweeter than Aztec chocolate? The smell of victory!</string>
    <string _locid="91273">These British will not rule our icy seas!</string>
    <string _locid="91274">These Dutch have no idea how to prepare a good herring, and it will lead to their defeat!</string>
    <string _locid="91275">These French are ready to meet their Waterloo today.</string>
    <string _locid="91276">The Germans sold us their soldiers; now we're beating them with their own men!</string>
    <string _locid="91277">The Haudenosaunee made promising changes to their arsenal, but it was never a match for mine.</string>
    <string _locid="91278">These Ottomans could not keep their gunpowder dry, and that has led to their downfall.</string>
    <string _locid="91279">The shipbuilding techniques of the Portuguese will not save them now.</string>
    <string _locid="91280">Who fears the Russians? I am the king in the north!</string>
    <string _locid="91281">The Lakota never stood a chance against our sturdy Finnhorses.</string>
    <string _locid="91282">How do you break the Spanish Tercio? - With a cannonball! Ha-ha-ha!</string>
    <string _locid="91283">The Inca were trying to hide in the mountains. They truly underestimated the range of cannons!</string>
    <string _locid="91284">The Chinese invented gunpowder, and I showed them how to use it.</string>
    <string _locid="91285">The Japanese didn't shy away from a fight, but their honor could not save them from superior weaponry!</string>
    <string _locid="91286">No Indian elephant is too big for my cannons!</string>
    <string _locid="91287">The Aztec Jaguar warriors with their obsidian blades are worthy foes for my lion-hearted soldiers!</string>
    <string _locid="91288">The British have built a professional army and expanded their arsenal. Time to launch an attack!</string>
    <string _locid="91289">It's getting serious. The Dutch sold all of their tulips to field more cannons than I can.</string>
    <string _locid="91290">The armor of the French cuirassiers gleams in the sun. I shall respond with the light of my cannons!</string>
    <string _locid="91291">The Germans must have untold riches to muster such a big army. We should sack their towns!</string>
    <string _locid="91292">The Haudenosaunee have quickly mastered the latest military tactics and become a formidable foe.</string>
    <string _locid="91293">The Ottoman artillery is loud and numerous, but my gunners can also hit their targets!</string>
    <string _locid="91294">The Portuguese outmaneuver us and know how to keep our troops at bay.</string>
    <string _locid="91295">The Russians have reformed their army and hold numerical superiority. Follow my lead!</string>
    <string _locid="91296">The Lakota army has grown and moves swiftly on the battlefield. There is no time to catch a breath!</string>
    <string _locid="91297">The Spanish deploy their forces with excellence, but can they compete with mine?</string>
    <string _locid="91298">The Incas are great in number and fierce melee fighters.</string>
    <string _locid="91299">The mighty Chinese army is upgrading its weaponry. Let us attack now or they will tip the odds in their favor!</string>
    <string _locid="91300">The Japanese Samurai are carving their way through our ranks with their sharp katanas. Impressive.</string>
    <string _locid="91301">Cannons on elephants, sword whips and blade arms. The Indians are trying to outsmart us!</string>
    <string _locid="91302">Uh... I'm right behind you! It won't be long...</string>
    <string _locid="91303">Already? Tell me, how do you manage to develop so quickly?</string>
    <string _locid="91304">Don't stay in the first age. Marvelous technologies await us!</string>
    <string _locid="91305">You must advance to the next age! Technological advancements will lead to our victory!</string>
    <string _locid="91306">Be careful. If your economic production does not grow, nor will your military.</string>
    <string _locid="91307">Finally, now we can get started.</string>
    <string _locid="91308">This battle is not in my interest, I shall focus my attention elsewhere in my empire.</string>
    <string _locid="91309">My camp is under attack! I request your aid so that I can turn this tide!</string>
    <string _locid="91310">My name is Gustavus Adolphus. I am destined for greatness!</string>
    <string _locid="91311">If you send me your battle plans I can make adjustments that will bring us victory!</string>
    <string _locid="91312">A higher difficulty this time? I see that you are finally rising to my level!</string>
    <string _locid="91313">Don't think I'll go easy on them just because you lowered the difficulty setting!</string>
    <string _locid="91314">Your ferocity is comparable to mine. Let us both overwhelm our enemies with it!</string>
    <string _locid="91315">I am grateful to have you by my side again.</string>
    <string _locid="91316">I'm glad you understand the value of having me as an ally, rather than as an enemy.</string>
    <string _locid="91317">Just give me a shout when you need my help again.</string>
    <string _locid="91318">We know this map well, my friend. An excellent advantage.</string>
    <string _locid="91319">It wasn't my fault that we lost last time. I trust you're done warming up?</string>
    <string _locid="91320">We are a dream team. Let us march all away across the land!</string>
    <string _locid="91321">I was forced to pay ransom for my explorer. Such a fall from grace from our proud past...</string>
    <string _locid="91322">Consider this a partial repayment of those... ancient debts I owe you.</string>
    <string _locid="91323">Your coffers are awkwardly empty.</string>
    <string _locid="91324">The cod catch was great this year. Here, share it with me.</string>
    <string _locid="91325">In Sweden we season our food with nothing but salt, but we do have lots of it! Here, have some.</string>
    <string _locid="91326">My forests are vast and my lumberjacks very efficient. You can have this wood, as a token of our friendship.</string>
    <string _locid="91327">With this timber you just might construct an empire as vast as mine!</string>
    <string _locid="91328">If we wait much longer, we will lose the advantage of surprise. I must march to battle!</string>
    <string _locid="91329">We will win this war by always making the first move. March, men!</string>
    <string _locid="91330">I will crush these natives the same way that I crushed the Snapphanes!</string>
    <string _locid="91331">Let's see if your invisible hand can stop me from plundering your trade!</string>
    <string _locid="91332">With God and the victorious arms, we shall win this fight!</string>
    <string _locid="91333">My army needs room to expand. I shall build another military base.</string>
    <string _locid="91334">I shall found a new city for the Swedish Empire!</string>
    <string _locid="91335">Take this coin. You seem like you need it.</string>
    <string _locid="91336">Do you like fish? I can throw you a red herring.</string>
    <string _locid="91337">We'll send you some of our finest lumber!</string>
    <string _locid="91338">If an ally is in need, Sweden will answer!</string>
    <string _locid="91339">I do not do well in peacetime... perhaps we could start just a tiny war?</string>
    <string _locid="91340">All of this inaction is making my troops anxious.</string>
    <string _locid="91341">My population is too small to support my giant army. Could you spare me some coin?</string>
    <string _locid="91342">Winter has been harsh in Sweden. Could you spare us some food?</string>
    <string _locid="91343">I used my last wood to build a giant goat and someone burned it down. Could you spare me some of yours?</string>
    <string _locid="91344">We'll spend the coin wisely on our technological advancement. </string>
    <string _locid="91345">It's no pickled herring, but it will have to do.</string>
    <string _locid="91346">Thank you. I will not forget this generous contribution.</string>
    <string _locid="91347">After all the times I have carried you, I am happy that you saw fit to pay some of it back.</string>
    <string _locid="91348">We'll craft masterful constructions with your wood. Many thanks.</string>
    <string _locid="91349">The Aztecs are dominating the battlefield. Today, I have sacrified my honor.</string>
    <string _locid="91350">The British have defeated us! We shall not be ruling the waves today.</string>
    <string _locid="91351">The Dutch have come to pillage my settlement...again!</string>
    <string _locid="91352">I did not expect such fierceness from the French. Today, I shall surrender.</string>
    <string _locid="91353">The Germans are furious. Are they still upset about Magdeburg - or is it my name?</string>
    <string _locid="91354">The tomahawks of the Haudenosaunee always seem to find their target. Their technique is formidable.</string>
    <string _locid="91355">I cannot believe that the Ottomans are running us off... again!</string>
    <string _locid="91356">I do not want to become lost in the smoke from the Portuguese cannons. We should pull back.</string>
    <string _locid="91357">The Russian army is too big for a pitched battle. We should retreat to fight another day.</string>
    <string _locid="91358">The Lakota are pushing back my troops with unmatched perseverance. We should retreat immediately!</string>
    <string _locid="91359">The Spanish came for our gold, but we spent it all on this lost war! We should surrender.</string>
    <string _locid="91360">Despite our advanced weaponry, the Inca are dominating the battle. We should capitulate.</string>
    <string _locid="91361">Let the Chinese be the central kingdom so long as we can keep the north.</string>
    <string _locid="91362">United under one banner and with all of their swords facing us, the Japanese fighting prowess is too much to handle.</string>
    <string _locid="91363">Camelry and elephants trample my horses... why did I decide to pick a fight with the Indians?</string>
    <string _locid="91364">Let us negotiate a truce with the Aztecs, so my botanists can at least take a good look at their floating gardens.</string>
    <string _locid="91365">The British are still using archers on the battlefield? It seems that I underestimated this ancient weaponry.</string>
    <string _locid="91366">These Dutch took all of our fish! No wonder we have been defeated.</string>
    <string _locid="91367">We are no match for the mighty French. An alliance will be in our interests for the next war.</string>
    <string _locid="91368">The Germans noticed that the Schwedentrunk doesn't taste like beer. We should break camp - now!</string>
    <string _locid="91369">The Haudenosaunee used all of the trees for woodworking! We had nothing left for ourselves.</string>
    <string _locid="91370">It appears that the Ottomans brought guns of their own. Who would have thought?</string>
    <string _locid="91371">The Portuguese opened fire before my cannons were in position. Retreat!</string>
    <string _locid="91372">These Russians brought guns to a snowball fight. No wonder we lost.</string>
    <string _locid="91373">The Lakota horses move too swiftly for our gunners. We should return to target practice.</string>
    <string _locid="91374">My soldiers underestimated the length of Spanish pikes. Now victory is literally out of reach.</string>
    <string _locid="91375">I was a fool for trusting the old adage. These Inca sticks and stones break my bones indeed!</string>
    <string _locid="91376">I hate to admit it, but the inventions of the Chinese leave me stumped. How can I fight against this?</string>
    <string _locid="91377">I figured that the Japanese would be too busy fighting among themselves to oppose us, but it seems that I was mistaken.</string>
    <string _locid="91378">The Indians fight like tigers, and we just became their prey.</string>
    <string _locid="91379">It is time for me to fade away. I have lost the game, and no one is to blame... here I go!</string>
    <string _locid="91380">We are in the worst game, we are in last place, and you are the worst part of this team. Do you know how bad that makes you!?</string>
    <string _locid="91381">My men march with ferocity! Our victory is ensured!</string>
    <string _locid="91382">You are tough as leather! You have proven to be a worthy ally to Sweden!</string>
    <string _locid="91383">The Lion of the North roars again! You are honoured to have me by your side.</string>
    <string _locid="91384">Today we were outsmarted! Let us resign and fight again another day.</string>
    <string _locid="91385">A good general recognizes when the battle is lost. Let us resign with honor.</string>
    <string _locid="91386">I am longing to go back to Stockholm. Can we stop this bloodshed?</string>
    <string _locid="91387">Our enemy lives a life of wealth through trade. If we let them continue like this, it will put my treasury to shame.</string>
    <string _locid="91388">Many of the natives have been rallied to oppose us. Such auxiliaries benefit our enemy far too well.</string>
    <string _locid="91389">I hope that we can find many treasures in this new world.</string>
    <string _locid="91390">A decent find.</string>
    <string _locid="91391">Is that the most exotic find that this place has to offer?</string>
    <string _locid="91392">Spend that food wisely. An army cannot march on an empty stomach!</string>
    <string _locid="91393">Don't tell me that you will be ignoring the war to pursue your treasure hunting obsession?</string>
    <string _locid="91394">That discovery was in my territory! Keep to your own lands!</string>
    <string _locid="91395">You may recruit help from the locals if you so wish.</string>
    <string _locid="91396">A passable demonstration of kindness. At least you made the settlers happy.</string>
    <string _locid="91397">As exotic that wood might be, will the houses you build with them be as beautiful as mine?</string>
    <string _locid="91398">I have claimed a treasure! Soon, my future vision will be reality.</string>
    <string _locid="91399">As soon as these coins are polished, they will be fit for my coffers!</string>
    <string _locid="91400">Enough food for seconds at my banquet!</string>
    <string _locid="91401">I figured that you were not interested in keeping that for yourself.</string>
    <string _locid="91402">I'm quite enjoying this treasure hunt.</string>
    <string _locid="91403">An extra pair of helping hands from those who know the land better than us.</string>
    <string _locid="91404">My daring expedition to rescue these settlers was a success!</string>
    <string _locid="91405">I wonder how many Dalecarlian horses I can carve with this wood?</string>
    <string _locid="91406">I did not build this wall because I cannot stand the outside world. I just need a break from it.</string>
    <string _locid="91407">Wealth is imminent! Tonight we shall feast as our forefathers did.</string>
    <string _locid="91408">So, you have chosen the coward's way to to victory? It will cost you dearly!</string>
    <string _locid="91409">A king, warlord, and businessman. That's me!</string>
    <string _locid="91410">You may have new tools at hand, but do you have anyone to use them?</string>
    <string _locid="91411">You... do know how to age up, right?</string>
    <string _locid="91412">Are you still an age behind? Your mother would be so ashamed of you!</string>
    <string _locid="91413">You have advanced to the next age? We will be there shortly and outshine your technological advances!</string>
    <string _locid="91414">Well, you can't place first every time... or ever, in your case.</string>
    <string _locid="91415">Aaaand in last place we have... you! Congratulations!</string>
